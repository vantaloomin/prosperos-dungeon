# Vallarith world package (draft)

Vallarith is a grimdark high-fantasy world. Magic is a physical current called the Ley, the Old
Gods are missing, the New Gods are a few lifetimes old, the Eternal Dragons cannot breed, and the
world itself was rebuilt as a prison for the King of the Nine Hells. Survival costs morality.

This folder is the content draft for Milestone 5 (see `docs/roadmap.md`). It is shaped like the
Markdown and JSON folder export described under "World packages" in `docs/requirements.md`, so the
Milestone 5 importer can read it into the world's SQLite file section by section, with review. No
app code reads it yet.

Built from Vanta's Vallarith source material (see [sources.md](sources.md)). Every entry is
rewritten in fresh prose; nothing is copied from the source files or from outside wikis.

| `assets/maps/` | Assets | The Known World map and the Ley Line map |

## Three eras

Vanta's call: one world, three times to start a campaign in. Pre-Reform (about 2750 AOM), the
Brotherhood Years (3001 to 3135 BOM) and Post-Reform (about 300 RFM, the default, where Kingswood
is set). Entries carry `eras` and `by_era` where facts change. See [canon/eras.md](canon/eras.md).

## Conventions

- **Ids** are lowercase kebab-case and unique within their file. Cross-references use ids
  (`"region": "badlands"`, `"faction": "brotherhood-of-man"`).
- **`origin`** on an entry says where it comes from: `source` (Vanta's material), `m1-slice` (the
  Kingswood town built for Milestone 1, which is the authority for Kingswood), or `draft` (invented
  here to fill a gap, for Vanta to approve or cut).
- **`ip`** marks where a name comes from: `original` (Vanta's own) or `myth` (public-domain myth or
  folklore). Names coined by Wizards of the Coast for D&D are replaced (Vanta, 2026-10-21); entries
  that changed carry `renamed_from`, and [canon/names.md](canon/names.md) lists every change
  (approved by Vanta).
- **Tiers** use the shared ladder from "Scaling and tiers": `local`, `regional`, `realm`, `world`,
  `mythic`.
- **MARVEL stats** run 1 to 30 with 10 as an ordinary adult (`Program/dungeon/rules/marvel.py`).
  Gods and Eternal Dragons in their true forms are beyond stats and carry a tier only.
- **Map positions** (`map: {x, y}`) are fractions of `assets/maps/vallarith.jpg`, from the top
  left, and are approximate.
- **Hidden truths** live in `hidden-truths.json`, in `secret` fields, and in the Eternal Dragons'
  `guise` and the New Gods' `mortal_life` fields, so an importer can mark them as hidden.
  `lore.json` holds only what a well-read local could know or hear.

## Status

Draft for review. See [open-questions.md](open-questions.md) for the canon calls this draft makes
and the ones still waiting on Vanta.
