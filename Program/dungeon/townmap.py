"""Town maps (requirements "### Town maps"): a street map of a town, laid out by code from the town's data and the
campaign's seed, never drawn by hand or by an image model.

- **From the data.** A town file already says where its neighborhoods are (lat and lon), which places are in which
  neighborhood, and where its rivers run. That is all the map needs: the town is cut into patches (a Voronoi diagram
  of points spread from the middle out), each patch near enough the middle belongs to the nearest neighborhood, the
  patch edges are its streets, and its main roads run along them from the square out to the edge. A neighborhood far
  out of town (Kingswood's cutting line, Hollin's Reachwall) is not drawn: a road leaves the map toward it.
- **The seed decides the rest.** The same town and seed always give the same map, so it never has to be stored.
  Another campaign's Kingswood has the same neighborhoods in the same places, with other streets.
- **Lots, filled as they are needed.** Each patch is split into lots, the town's buildings. The town's own places,
  employers and colleges are given lots in their own neighborhood when the map is laid out (an open place, a park or
  a square, takes a whole patch). Every other lot is blank: what is in it is decided when the character first looks
  (a later step), then kept.
- **Style.** The era picks the look unless the town's `town_map` says otherwise: 'ink' (a hand-inked old town, for
  fantasy and the past), 'street' (a modern grid) or 'floor' (a town on one floor of BABEL's tower, walled by it).
