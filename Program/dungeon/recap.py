"""While you were away: a short catch-up when the user comes back to a companion after a few days.

Shown once in the chat when the user's last message to this companion is at least `life_settings.recap_after_days`
old (3 by default, 0 turns it off), folded away once they have read it, and gone as soon as they write again.
It only summarizes what the world already decided while they were gone, so it never calls a model: chapters of
the companion's life, storylines that moved on, the biggest things they did, how many townsfolk they ran into and
the town paper issues that came out. Nothing from the secrets ledger, and nothing the companion would not share:
the same life the Today view shows. Templates pick the few biggest items; it is a summary, not a replay.
