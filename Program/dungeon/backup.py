"""Workspace backup archives with a Dungeon format marker.

An archive is a zip holding `manifest.json`, a consistent SQLite snapshot taken with the online
backup API, and the files its records name: finished images, adapters that have not been removed
and, when chosen, the reference pictures (PRD "selective dataset inclusion"). Each file sits at its
workspace-relative path, stored uncompressed and listed with its SHA-256. Training folders are
never included; a chosen checkpoint is already copied into `lora/adapters/`.

Restore only targets a new workspace path, validates the marker and every digest before writing
anything, checks the files the restored records name, and leaves the workspace paused for review:
automatic memory, background activity and automatic images off, keys and tool approvals dropped,
queued images and running training interrupted. Saved API keys are never in the database.
