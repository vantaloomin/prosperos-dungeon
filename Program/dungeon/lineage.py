"""How forked timelines relate to the ones they came from (PRD C4, M6, M12).

A fork copies its parent's conversation before the edited message, so every copy records the
message it was first written as (`origin_id`). Choices about a message, such as Don't remember
this, exclusion of a memory it supports, or deleting it, reach every copy of it, so a fork can
never bring back words the user removed elsewhere.

Memories are not copied. A timeline sees its own memories plus those its ancestors formed
before the fork, so fictional history before a historical edit carries over and nothing after it
does. Real-user profile facts may be shared across all timelines instead (a visible setting).
