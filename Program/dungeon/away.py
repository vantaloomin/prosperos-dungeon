"""One shared allowance for messages sent while the user is away.

Every companion may start a conversation on their own (dungeon/life/openers.py), and each such message
can cost a model call. Left running all day, that adds up across many companions, so they share one
allowance: at most `life_settings.away_daily` messages in any 24 hours, from everyone together. Group chats
draw from the same allowance: ask `allowed` before writing a message nobody asked for, and `record` it in
the same transaction that saves it. 0 means no one messages first.
