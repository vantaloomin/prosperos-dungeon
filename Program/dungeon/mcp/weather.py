"""Real weather for the companion's simulated day, when the user allows it (PRD X1, X3, W2).

A weather lookup for the companion's city (a real, modern place) can stand in for the city's
typical weather on that local date. Only a lookup made on that date counts, and only when a
temperature can be read from it; otherwise the day keeps its typical weather. The result is
marked `observed` with its source and time, so the context and the Today view never present
climate averages as a forecast or a lookup as anything other than what it is.
