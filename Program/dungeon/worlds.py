"""Worlds and personas: more than one life for the user, each in its own world.

A persona is the user as someone in particular: a name, a gender, an age, a birthday and a few lines about them.
A world is everything that happened to one persona there: their story and its town. Each persona has one or more
worlds, and two worlds may share a city.

Each world is a workspace of its own, one database in its own folder (the first world keeps the data folder's
own database, `Database.root`), so nothing in one world can reach another. Which worlds and personas there are
lives in `worlds.json` beside the first world. Switching points the app's one Database at the other world's file
(`Database.use`); what belongs to the user rather than to a world (model connections, image backends, voices,
settings, their own cities) is carried over from the world they leave, so it follows them.

"The world exists outside of User" (Vanta, 2026-10-08): nobody sets anything up. The first run makes the first
world with a blank persona; a new persona or world arrives ready in the city the user picked (the form starts on a
featured one the app picks).
