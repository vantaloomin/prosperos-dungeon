"""Worlds and personas: more than one life for the user, each in its own world.

A persona is the user as someone in particular: a name, a gender, an age, a birthday and a few lines about them.
A world is everything that happened to one persona there: its companions, their lives and town, the chats,
memories, feed and pictures. Each persona has one or more worlds, and two worlds may share a city.

Each world is a workspace of its own, one database in its own folder (the first world keeps the data folder's
own database, `Database.root`), so nothing in one world can reach another. Which worlds and personas there are
lives in `worlds.json` beside the first world. Switching points the app's one Database at the other world's file
(`Database.use`); what belongs to the user rather than to a world (model connections, image backends, voices,
settings, their own cities, paired phones) is carried over from the world they leave, so it follows them.

"The world exists outside of User" (Vanta, 2026-10-08): nobody sets anything up. An existing workspace silently
becomes the first world, with a persona made from what the app already knows about the user; a new persona or
world arrives ready in the city the user picked (the form starts on a featured one the app picks), and the user
makes its first companion there, as on a first run (Vanta, 2026-10-12: a new world starts with a blank companion to
create, not a townsperson). Becoming a townsperson is the exception: that world starts with someone from their
circle.
