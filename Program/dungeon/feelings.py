"""What the people met feel about the player's character, NPCs v0 (requirements "NPC minds").

Five separate tracks for each person met (story_people): trust, affection and respect from -5 to 5, fear and
desire from 0 to 5. Someone can fear and want the character while trusting them not at all. Code moves them:
- A roll aimed at someone by name moves them by its stat and how it landed (charm that works warms them, a threat
  that lands frightens them, a fight leaves fear and dislike).
- When a Continuity model is chosen, its question after each turn lists the people there, and it may say a turn
  moved one of them, with a short reason that is kept as their impression of the character.
The narrator is told each person's feelings in words, and they make asking them easier or harder: a warm person
is persuaded one step more easily, a hostile one a step less.

Feelings are game state, branched with the story (story_people is in dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
