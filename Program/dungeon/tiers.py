"""Scaling and tiers (requirements "Scaling and tiers"; docs/story.md "Scaling and tiers").

One tier ladder for every world and ruleset (LADDER), so code can compare the character, the work offered, the
regions and the foes. Each world names the track that sets the character's tier (world/data/tiers/<world>.json):
Vallarith's is renown, earned by work done.

- **The arc.** At campaign start the player picks how far the character can rise (ARCS: grounded stays low, classic
  runs from the street to the gods, epic starts high) and how fast (PACES); the world sets the defaults. The tier is
  the track's level, never below the arc's start or above its ceiling.
- **Work comes at the character's tier.** A job offered unasked is at their tier; now and then (STRETCH in 100) one
  a tier above, with a warning that it is beyond them. Nothing two tiers above ever comes to them; work below their
  tier comes only when they go looking for it (dungeon/jobs.py).
- **The world stays where it is.** Regions keep their tier (the travel map's `regions`). Walking into one above the
  character, the signs warn first, and the narrator is told. Foes a card brings are at the region's tier; a faction
  the character has made an enemy of, of a higher tier than the region, sends its own after them on the road.

The track is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
