"""The dating app: the user's profile, the swipe deck of townsfolk, matches, and new companions (docs/dating.md).

Who is on the app, what they are like and whether they like the user back are townsfolk rules
(dungeon/world/dating.py); this module keeps what the user did: their own profile and the city they are
looking in, who they swiped on, and any dates played out in Story mode. A match can become a companion
through the same path as switching to a townsperson (dungeon/cast.py), and is then chatted with like any
companion. No companion prompt reads the app itself: a companion never knows who else the user swiped on.

Modern and future cities have a dating app. Older eras have the same thing in period form: a personal
column in the paper (Victorian, steampunk, frontier, the 1920s) or the town matchmaker (medieval and fantasy).
