"""The user's chats, the way a messaging app lists them: who, the latest message and how many are unread.

Each companion has one chat, their active timeline. Other kinds of chat (group chats) add their own entries
through `KINDS` and keep their read position in the same table, keyed by their own id. Unread counts the
messages someone else sent after the last one the user saw or wrote; a held reply (dungeon/life/pacing.py) counts
once its time has come. Nothing here says whether anyone is around: no presence, no read receipts.
