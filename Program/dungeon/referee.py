"""The Referee (docs/requirements.md "Turn loop" and "Referee model"): splits the player's intent into actions and
decides, for each, whether it needs a roll, which MARVEL stat and how hard it is. Code then rolls.

A text model does it when one is chosen for the Referee job in Settings > Models; it answers in JSON and anything
it gets wrong is dropped. Without one, or when its answer cannot be read, keyword rules decide. The narrator's own
model is never borrowed for this, so a turn costs one narrator call unless the player asks for more.

A decision model, when one is chosen for Referee decisions, then decides each action's roll, stat and difficulty from
the odds it gives each answer (dungeon/providers/decisions.py), over the Referee's split or, without a Referee profile,
each sentence of the turn. It writes no text, so it costs one short read per action. That one may be the narrator's
own local model, since asking it for one token's odds is not a narrator call.
