"""Lasting injuries and treatment (requirements "Injuries and recovery"; docs/story.md "Lasting injuries" and
"Treatment").

Everything here follows one setting, **Injury persistence**: Permanent (the default), Temporary or None.

- **Lasting injuries are rolled.** A hit that leaves the character Maimed, a foe's critical hit, or a beating that
  nearly killed them rolls on the lasting-injury table (rules/injuries.json): a lost eye, a limp, a ruined hand, a
  scar. Each makes the actions it touches a step harder and has a look people react to; the narrator is told both.
  Under Permanent it stays (rare magic or a master healer may mend it later); under Temporary it fades after its
  days; under None nothing is rolled and nothing old shows.
- **Treatment takes a healer or supplies, and a roll, and can go wrong.** "I bandage the wound" with bandages or a
  poultice in the pack is a Mind roll of the character's, harder the worse the wound (a poultice makes it a step
  easier). A healer in the scene treats instead, for a fee, rolling their own skill. A success mends a level now (a
  critical two); a critical failure turns the wound bad, a level worse. A wound is treated once; a new one can be
  treated again.

All of it is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
