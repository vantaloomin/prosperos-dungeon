"""Lore from imported lorebooks (dungeon/imports/characters.py): what a companion or their world knows as fact.

A book belongs to one companion, or to the whole world (`companion_id` NULL, from a lorebook file imported on
its own). Each entry is plain text with keywords. Always-on entries sit in the system prompt with the rest of
what rarely changes; an entry with keywords joins the notes sent with a reply only while one of them is in the
last few messages, as a whole word in any letter case, like Prospero's Study's literal keyword matching
(server/lore/matching.py at bbcbde4). No pattern runs and no model picks entries.
