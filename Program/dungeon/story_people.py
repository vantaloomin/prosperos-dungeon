"""The people the user has met in their own story (Story mode, docs/story.md), kept apart from every companion.

Someone present in the scene is met once their name comes up: the narrator voices them giving it, or the
user uses it. Each local day they come up counts as one meeting. A few sentences of the story about them
are kept as notes, so the narrator remembers them the next time they are in the scene, however far back
the story has been trimmed. Townsfolk keep no memories of their own; this is the user's side only.

Their voice stays theirs (ported from Prospero's Companion 1.0, companion/memory/voice.py): lines the narration gave
someone, quoted in a paragraph that names only them, are kept (`heard`), and the narrator is shown one or two from
earlier meetings, so they keep sounding like themselves however far back the story is trimmed or whichever model
narrates. Rules only, no model call.
