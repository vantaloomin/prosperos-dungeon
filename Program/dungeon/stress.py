"""Stress: mental harm (requirements "Injuries and recovery": a stress track; docs/story.md "Stress").

Code keeps a stress track for the character, 0 to 12. Traumatic events add to it: the first kill, something
dreadful to fight (a foe marked horror), being beaten nearly to death, robbed and left, or taken prisoner, a lasting
injury. Each time, the character resists with a Resolve roll: a critical success shrugs it off, a success takes
half, a failure all of it, a critical failure one more.

Past each threshold (4, 8, 12), and every time more lands at the top, code rolls a lasting condition of the mind
from the table (rules/injuries.json `conditions`): nightmares, a fear of the dark, numbness, a temper. They work
like lasting injuries (dungeon/injuries.py), under the same Injury persistence setting, and the narrator plays them.
Each good night of rest eases the track by one (dungeon/rest.py).

The track is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
