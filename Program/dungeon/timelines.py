"""Alternative timelines: historical edits, switching and freezing (PRD C4, T7, M6).

Branching from a message, or editing one of the user's earlier messages, never rewrites the live
relationship. It creates a separate, inactive timeline holding a copy of everything up to that
message (before it, for an edit): the conversation, the companion's
committed events and the posts showing them, the circle and the circle's diary. The edited words
wait on the new timeline as its draft until they are sent there. Memories are not copied; a
timeline sees what its ancestors remembered before the fork (dungeon/lineage.py).

Only the active timeline advances with real time. Choosing another one freezes the active one:
its unreviewed events are rejected, its unfinished batches stop, its hidden upcoming agenda is
dropped, and replies still being written there are stopped and withheld. Both revisions advance,
so any work that finishes later is revalidated and cannot reach the newly active companion (T7).
A timeline's life resumes from the moment it is chosen; time spent frozen is never filled in.
