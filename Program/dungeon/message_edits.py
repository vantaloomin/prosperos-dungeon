"""Editing a companion reply in place, from the reply's Edit or the sidecar. A stopped reply can be edited too,
and the edit makes it the finished reply. The user's own messages are not edited here:
memories come from the user's words, so changing those is Edit on the message (a new timeline) instead.

An edited reply is what every later reply and recall sees. What the old wording said about her goes with
it, the way it does when a reply is replaced (docs/architecture.md): self-facts the user has not decided
on and plans she made in that reply are noted again from the new text. Each edit keeps the text it
replaced in `message_edits`, so it can be undone by editing back.
