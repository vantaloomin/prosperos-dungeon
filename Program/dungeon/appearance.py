"""How the character looks right now (requirements "Inventory and equipment": appearance state and visible gear;
docs/story.md "How you look").

Code keeps the character's look and the narrator describes it the same way every turn:
- **Cleanliness:** clean, worn, grimy or filthy (GRIME), with marks (blood, mud, sweat, other fluids, smoke). A
  journey, a night camped, a fight, a day's hard work or sex raise it; washing lowers it and clears the marks, and a
  paid bath or laundry (dungeon/inventory.py services) clears it all.
- **Clothing condition:** intact, rumpled, torn or ruined (CLOTHES). A wound in a fight tears them, sex rumples them;
  the laundry presses them, mending (a service) fixes a tear, and new clothes bought replace ruined ones.
- **State of dress,** per layer (outer, under, accessories): worn, loosened or off, and where what came off was left.
  A line that undresses, loosens or dresses moves them.
- **On show:** what the character wears and wields that anyone can see: a weapon carried, a wound's bandage.
A world can set its city's `appearance` to 'basic' (cleanliness and condition only, no state of dress). All of it is
game state (story_appearance, dungeon/timeline.py SAVED); each line's change is decided once (story_appearance_turns),
so telling it again changes nothing more.
