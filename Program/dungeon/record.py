"""The record and the story so far (docs/story.md "The record"; requirements "Memory and context").

The record is the source of truth: facts as structured entries (deaths, items, wounds, promises, locations,
secrets, relationships, other facts), each marked as world truth, the character's belief, or both. Code records
the facts it decides; after each narration the Continuity model, when one is chosen for that job, lists the new
facts the narrator brought in, and code keeps those that do not contradict the record. The narrator is given the
record every turn and never contradicts it.

Extraction is schema-first: the model fills a JSON Schema of record entries (plus the other systems' questions,
each with its own part of the schema), which the backend enforces where it can (dungeon/providers/requests.py
`structured`). A model that cannot fill it is asked again without it, and a weak one that still gives nothing
readable is asked one field at a time.

The player sees and corrects what their character knows (truth 'belief' or 'both'); every correction is logged.
Hidden truth ('world') stays out of their view, except in the GM view (workspace setting `gm_view`), which shows
and edits everything and can ask again for, or clear, a single fact the model extracted.

The story so far: the narrator reads the most recent messages word for word and, before them, one rolling summary.
When enough older messages pile up, they are folded into the summary by the Continuity model (or the Default one).

Both are game state, kept per branch (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
