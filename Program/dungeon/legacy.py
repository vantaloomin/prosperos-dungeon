"""Campaign files and legacy (requirements "Campaign management": "a full campaign file (record, branches, saves,
settings) for backup or moving machines, importable again", and "at campaign start the player may import a finished
campaign's outcome as world history, so an old character can be a legend, a villain or a corpse"; docs/story.md
"Export and legacy").

- **The campaign file** is a verified Dungeon archive of the world being played (dungeon/backup.py): its whole
  database, so every branch, save, the record and the settings. Imported, it becomes a new world of its own, under
  the persona it was played by (made again when this install has no such persona); credentials stay behind.
- **Legacy.** Another world's story, ended or not, can be brought into a new campaign as history: its character,
  how they ended, and what the chapters say they did. As a **legend**, the world remembers them and their deeds.
  As a **villain**, they live on, hidden, and turned: a nemesis who comes back through the director. As a
  **corpse**, they are dead, and the record says so, so the narrator never has them act. The facts are weight 3, so
  they never fade.
