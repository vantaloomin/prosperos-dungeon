"""Bounded, deterministic consolidation (PRD M11): episode summaries and duplicate proposals.

Nothing here calls a model. An episode summary quotes the user's own sentences from one day, keeps
the exact source messages, and is a replaceable retrieval aid: it never becomes a source for
extraction, never confirms anything, and is dropped once any of its sources is deleted, declined or
blocked by an exclusion. Duplicate memories are only proposed; the user decides. Each run handles
a bounded number of days and commits only if the memory revision did not change while it worked.
