"""Dungeon context builder (PRD M10), replacing the Study's Story-path assemble_memory.

Eligibility (authority, scope, exclusion, time) is applied before ranking. Character guidance and
the user's boundaries are required: if they cannot fit, the builder reports the limit instead of
dropping them. Everything else is added in priority order until the budget is spent, and the

    'user speaking out of character. Answer that message plainly and honestly, then go back to being {name}.\n'
