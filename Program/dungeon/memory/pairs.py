"""Closeness between people: how close a companion and someone else in their world feel to each other.

The same five stages as the user's own closeness (memory/closeness.py), worked out from shared history every
time they are needed. It runs both ways: `closeness(a, b)` is how close `a` feels to `b`, which can be a step
apart from how `b` feels about `a`. Only pairs with at least one companion are ever worked out; two townsfolk,
or two circle people, are never computed, so the thousands of townsfolk in a city cost nothing.

Where a pair starts:
- two companions: "Just met", or higher the more often they have run into each other around town, unless the
  user wrote how they know each other when they were first put together (a group, or becoming a companion);
- a companion and someone in their circle: a default by the circle role, nudged one step up or down by the
  person's seed (some families are tight, some distant; not every close friend is the closest);
- a companion and a townsperson: higher the more often they have met (#204's rule for the user).

What moves it, all by rules: days both spoke in the same group (one a day, however long the talk), group
messages the user kept as a shared moment while both were there (never more than the days), good-news storyline
beats about a circle person, and falling-out beats with them (a step down, won back when they make up). Gentle
cooling after long silences follows the companion's own cooling switch (#204). A guarded secret someone found
out (the secrets ledger) lowers how they feel about the people it is about, but only when their character sheet
says they react that way: there is no built-in jealousy or betrayal. Someone whose "I see myself" lines show a
mask may keep others a step further than they are kept.

Only the one-time backstory is stored (`pair_backstories`); the user has no other dials between people.
