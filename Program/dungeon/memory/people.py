"""The people in the user's real life: who they are, what the user said about them, and what to ask next.

People are learned from the user's own statements under the same consent as every other memory
(automatic memory, or Remember this): `people_rules` finds them, formation matches each mention to a
stored person, and every fact about them is an ordinary memory carrying `person_id`. So correcting,
excluding and deleting work as they do for any memory, and a person with no memories left is removed.

Follow-up questions are picked here, without a model: recent news first ("Jo got engaged" a few days
ago), then a missing name, then a light check-in on someone who has not come up for a while. At most
one is offered at a time, rarely, never about a loss or anyone a boundary covers, and the model only
phrases it if it fits the conversation. The same question is not offered twice.
