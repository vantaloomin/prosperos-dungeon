"""Our history at a glance (Hit List #16): the shape of the whole relationship, one line at a time.

One line a week lately, one a month further back and one a year before that, oldest first, from the first talk to
the end of last week. Every line is built from what really happened on the active timeline, by rules and templates,
never by a model: the days they talked, the user's own words (the day summaries, dungeon/memory/consolidation.py),
the shared moments remembered and how they got closer (dungeon/memory/closeness.py), then the companion's own big
turns (life chapters and trips). A stretch with only talking in it (or none) says just that, and such stretches in a
row share one line.

The same lines go two places: the chat context, with the sections that rarely change so the start of the prompt
stays cacheable (they change once a week, when a week is over), and the scrapbook's "All of it" view, where the user
reads them and corrects any line in their own words or leaves it out. A correction replaces the line in both, and
when a week has become part of a month (or a month part of a year) the user's words come along into that line.

The size is fixed: at most WEEKS_BACK weeks plus the rest of their month, MONTHS_BACK months, then one line a year,
each line at most LINE_LIMIT characters for its stretch. Deleted, declined or blocked memories and messages never
show.
