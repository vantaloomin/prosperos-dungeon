"""Model-found memories (PRD M1, M7): background-only, saved like rule-found facts.

With model memory on (with automatic memory; both on by default since 2026-10-07), the sentences of each message
the rules found nothing in are sent in small batches to the configured model at maintenance priority. Each answer
must name a message in the batch and use that message's own words. A supported answer is saved as an automatic
memory, shown as saved automatically in Memories where the user can correct or delete it; a sensitive one waits
while sensitive memory is off. Each message goes with the user's current facts its words touch (`known`); an
answer that says one of them is wrong (`corrects`, which must name one that was sent), or that negates the one
current memory with its layer and subject, corrects that memory (`corrections.py`), and a new value for a
single-valued subject replaces the current one, which ends as history. The user's own core facts (home city, work,
name, birthday) are the exception: a model answer that would replace or correct one waits as a suggestion with what it
replaces, since the rules already catch a plainly stated change ("I moved to Denver").
