"""Old words of a corrected memory, marked wherever recall can still find them (M9, M12).

Correcting a memory makes a new revision of it (or, for a value that was never true, retracts it),
but the words it came from stay in the transcript. Raw recall can still find the user's original
message, the companion's reply to it, a later reply of hers that repeated the old value, and a day
summary quoting it; offered bare, they would put the wrong fact back in front of the model as
something the user said. So each of those gets a note naming what the user changed it to, or that
they said it was wrong. Worked out with rules from saved state on every reply, nothing stored, so
deleting or excluding the memory takes its notes with it.
