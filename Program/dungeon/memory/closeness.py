"""Closeness stages: visible familiarity that grows with shared history (PRD M3, M4).

The stage is worked out from the active timeline's history every time it is needed, never stored as
a score. It counts the days the user talked (a quick hello and a long talk count the same, so more
messages never earn more) and the shared moments remembered, which can never outrun those days.
Time apart never lowers it unless the user turns on gentle cooling for this companion. The user sees the stage
and why it changed, can set it to any stage (or a step closer or further) and let it keep growing from there,
hold it, cap it, give a nickname, add or remove running jokes (moments that keep coming up become one on
their own) and restart the count. A new companion can start at any stage (the character's `starting_closeness`).

The stage changes how open the companion is: what they share, nicknames and in-jokes. It follows
the relationship style the user chose, never makes emotional traits stronger, and is never used to
pressure the user or to reward time spent.
