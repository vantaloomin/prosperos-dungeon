"""The memory model reads the companion's replies for what they say about themselves (realism: her own facts).

The rules in dungeon/self_facts.py catch "my sister Ashley" but not "we're the Harbor Hellions" said in answer
to "what's your derby team called?", so in the six-month test the team's name drifted from month to month.
With model memory on, each completed companion message is queued here and sent in small batches, with the
message it answered, to the memory model at maintenance priority. Each answer must name a message in the batch
and use that message's own words; it is then noted like a rule-found fact (`self_facts.record`), so a different
value for something on record waits as a conflict instead of replacing it.
