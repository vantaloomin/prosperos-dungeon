"""Committed fictional events: the single shared account for chat, feed and recall (PRD T2–T3, T7, F1).

A proposal records the character version, timeline and permission revision it was made under.
Commit revalidates all three, so work that finishes after a pause, correction or timeline switch
cannot affect the active companion. The idempotency key makes a repeated commit a no-op.
