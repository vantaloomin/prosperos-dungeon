"""Flagged passages and Rewrite (requirements "Flagged passages and Rewrite"; docs/story.md "Rewrite").

What a turn's checks find and do not fix is kept with the narration as flags, one per paragraph, each with why: a
strong prose tell the rewrite pass left (or never ran on, over budget), or someone the record says is dead when the
contradiction check gave way for time. The player can rewrite a flagged paragraph, or any passage they select, with
an optional note. A rewrite changes the wording only: the dice, the bands and the record's facts stay, so nothing is
rolled again. The wording before the last rewrite is kept, so the player can switch back.

The reason never gives away hidden truth: a clash with a death the character does not know of says only that the
passage conflicts with the story so far.
