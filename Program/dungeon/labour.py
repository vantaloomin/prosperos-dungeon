"""Day labour (requirements "Shops and services": money comes in as well as goes out).

A line that spends a stretch of the day working in a town ("I spend the day hauling logs for the yard", "I work the
saws for three hours") is paid the town's day wage (the `day-wage` price, dungeon/happenings.py wage), pro rata for
the hours, up to a full day. The story clock has already passed the time (dungeon/story_clock.py SPANS and waited);
this only pays it, once for each line (story_cards, scene 'work').
