"""Profile pictures made while setting up a companion.

Three pictures of the same person, the second and third each made from the first:

1. the profile picture: waist up, facing the camera, in an everyday outfit, with an expression
   that fits their personality;
2. a three-quarter view in a second everyday outfit, following picture 1;
3. a close-up of the face, following picture 1.

The whole set goes to one backend that can take a reference picture (backends.takes_reference),
in the user's order. When none can, nothing is sent unless the user explicitly asks for the set
to be made from the description alone, so a set of three unrelated people is never passed off
as one. Each picture is classified and routed like any image (PRD F6): Prohibited is refused
everywhere and NSFW goes only to a backend that accepts it.

The set is a `lora_generations` row of kind `portraits`, so it runs through the same runner,
admission rules and keep step as the LoRA maker's generated pictures. Kept pictures join the
character's reference set, and the kept profile picture becomes the companion's picture.
Expression and outfits are drafted from fixed lists without a model, and are editable.
