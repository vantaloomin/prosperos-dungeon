"""Optional model phrasing of a composed event (PRD T2, T3).

The composer has already decided what happened and where. The model only rewrites the wording
in the character's voice; it is told not to add places, people, prices or events, and a reply
that drops the named place or breaks the format is discarded in favour of the template text.
It never sees the user's memories: a life event is the companion's own fiction.
