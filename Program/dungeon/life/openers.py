"""The companion texts first (realism: real people start conversations too).

Fixed triggers decide when the companion opens a conversation, from saved state only: a plan the
user mentioned whose day has passed, news from the companion's own committed life, an event that
touches something the user told them, a follow-up the companion promised ("tell me how the search
is going later") once they have a free moment, an ordinary check-in at a break in their day (lunch,
after work or class, a free evening; rolled with seeded dice, so not every day), a message at a time the user is
usually around (learned from when they start conversations, see usual_hours.py: a lunch question when they often
write at lunch), or, only for a
character given an absence trait, a long silence. The facts come from that state; a model only
phrases the message in the character's voice, and a trigger that needs phrasing waits when no model
is connected.

Every companion does this, in focus or not, so a day with the app left running comes back to messages
from several of them. It is on by default and the user can turn it off. It never texts while the workspace
is paused, during quiet hours, while the companion is asleep, soon after the last message, more often than
the daily cap, twice in a row without an answer, or once all companions together have used the shared
allowance for messages while the user is away (dungeon/away.py). Each trigger fires once per timeline. The message is saved as
an ordinary companion message with no `reply_to`, so the next reply sees it in the transcript.
Messages from an old chat brought in (dungeon/imports/chats.py) are history: never the last message, a promise
to follow up or a reason to wait, and a plan only an old chat mentioned is never followed up.
