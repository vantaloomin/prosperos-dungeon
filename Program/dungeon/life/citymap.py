"""The city map (Hit List #40): where the companion lives and goes, and every place in their city to click.

Everything comes from state the app already keeps, with no model: the city pack's neighbourhoods and places,
the companion's home, the places their committed life events happened at (usual ones and recent ones),
Story mode's current scene, and townsfolk the companion knows who are regulars or staff somewhere. Places
have no coordinates in the city packs, so each sits at a small seeded offset from its neighbourhood's centre
and says its location is approximate. Real public cities are drawn on a street map in the interface; the
rest (fictional, original and private cities) on a sketch of their neighbourhoods. The map never shows
where the user is.
