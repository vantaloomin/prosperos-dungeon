"""Running into townsfolk: the companion meets the city's background people while out (dungeon/world/townsfolk.py).

When an agenda slot takes the companion somewhere real (a cafe, a park, a bar), the townsfolk who are
there by their own rules at that hour may cross paths with them. The first time is a chat with a
stranger ("Got talking with Dana Kim, the barista there, who talked a mile a minute"); each time after,
the companion learns more: what they are working toward and how it is going, then their flaw and what
they seem to want. One meeting a day at most, so the city feels lived in without crowding the diary.

Only the meeting is saved (timeline, person key, slot). Like acquaintances (dungeon/life/network.py), a
meeting counts once its slot has happened and the agenda entry still records it, so a rebuilt day can't
leave a stale one behind. The person themself is rebuilt from their key each time. No model is involved.
