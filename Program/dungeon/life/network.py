"""Friends of friends: the people around the companion's circle, a few layers out.

Everyone in the circle has their own people (a partner, friends, coworkers, a sibling, a roommate),
and each of those has theirs, down to MAX_DEPTH layers from the companion. Nobody out there is
stored or simulated: a person is a seeded path from a circle member (`circle:<timeline>:<n>/2/0`),
built the same way every time it is asked for, with an era-fitting name from the world data
(dungeon/world/naming.py). Most of them never come up.

They come up at gatherings and run-ins. A free circle friend now and then hosts something on a
Friday or Saturday evening (a Friendsgiving in November, a summer barbecue, game night), and the
companion goes when free: they meet a few of the host's people, sometimes one of theirs too. Who
they met is saved as an acquaintance with how they know them ("Jordan Lee, Becca's coworker, met
at Becca's Friendsgiving"), counted once the evening has happened. Later the companion may run
into one of them around town. The chat context lists recent acquaintances, so the companion can
say "you're Jordan from Becca's Friendsgiving!" No model is involved.
