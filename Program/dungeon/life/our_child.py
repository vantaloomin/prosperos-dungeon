"""Our child (Hit List #73, v0.15 Room to Grow): the child the user and a romance companion had or took in together
(dungeon/life/expecting.py), growing up in real time.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08). Rules and seeds only, no
model:

- The child is in `circle_children` (title 'ours', parent_id the companion) with their birthday; their age comes from
  it. A short sheet from the bank (dungeon/world/data/our_child.json), seeded by the child: a temperament for life,
  what they are into lately (a new pick each month) and a quirk (each season), by age band (baby, toddler, small
  child, school age, teen), lines that fit their city's era only.
- Milestones come in real time from their birthday (first smile, first word, first steps, the first day of school
  ...), each on a seeded day; once reached they are a Today line and go in the scrapbook.
- Family life changes the companion's days by rules, as much as Settings > Realism > Family life says (`family_life`,
  0 easy kids, only the good days, to 3 true-to-life chaos): broken nights until the child sleeps through (tired, so
  lower), bedtimes and the school run, childcare from their money, a sitter for evenings out, sick days off work,
  and family days out (a walk in the park, the zoo) as outings with the user, the child in words only.
- Who stays home is the engine's `family:care`, from both their jobs and their money: both keep working, the
  companion goes part-time, stays home, or the user does. The user can change it on the Character page.
- Their people become grandparents, aunts and uncles, with lines of their own; holidays and traditions grow the
  child's part as they grow.
- At 18 the child is an adult person in their circle (`grow_up`), never a romance, and never in
  a chat with the adult side's lines.

Children keep v0.14's limits everywhere: words only (the child's name is in families.names, so no picture is made of
words naming them, and a family day out has no photo), and with the adult side of life on a reply carries the family
lines or the adult side's, never both (dungeon/memory/sides.py; `quiet` keeps it off the calendar). A second child
can come as its own step, no sooner than a year and a half after the first came home (dungeon/life/parenthood.py).
