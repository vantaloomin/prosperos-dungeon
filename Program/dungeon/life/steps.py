"""Next steps (Hit List #60, v0.13 Life Together): the steps a relationship moves up, one ladder for every pair.

A pair (the user and a companion now; a companion and their partner later) sits on a ladder of steps, each stored with
the day it was reached (table relationship_steps). Romance goes dating, exclusive, the first "I love you", meeting their
people, a key to their place, moving in, engaged and married; a friendship goes friends, best friends, a first trip
together and standing up at their wedding. Mentor, family and other have no ladder. The step is never a score: it is
where things stand, said in one plain line on the Character page ("Together 8 months, exclusive") and in the chat
context, which keeps the companion from acting further along than they are.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- A companion with no steps yet starts at one the app picks, with no question asked: from how they know each other
  ("married for ten years" starts at married), else from closeness and the days talked (`start`).
- Once enough time has passed at a step and closeness is high enough, the consequence engine decides when they bring
  up the next one (choice `steps:when`: soon, in a few weeks or in a couple of months, from the Relationship pace slider,
  their description, their personality sliders and their mood lately). On that day they bring it up in a first text
  (dungeon/life/openers.py). The user's answer is read from the chat with fixed phrases: yes moves up, "not yet" waits
  and they ask again weeks later, no keeps it where it is for a long while. Only the user's first reply after the ask is
  read whatever it says; a later message counts when it names the step, or is a clear yes or no right after they
  brought it up again (`answer_to`). No answer in a few days counts as not yet.
- The user can raise the next step themselves ("can we be exclusive?", "I love you"), caught from the chat with fixed
  phrases the way recommendations are; the engine decides their answer (`steps:answer`) before the reply is written,
  and the reply says it.
- Friends can fall for you: now and then a close friend falls for the user (`steps:falls`, rare on a real life, likelier
  with more drama, never with the switch off or the companion's "just friends" lock on). It is a confession, never a
  silent change: yes makes them a romance at dating (a new character version), no keeps the friendship after a short
  awkward spell (a mood mark). The user can tell a friend how they feel too (`steps:friend_answer`).
- A step is where things stand, not a life change: living together, engaged and married move nobody house and plan no
  wedding. Married is never brought up by them; the user sets it on the Character page, where any step can be set or
  moved back.

Each step is an anniversary (dungeon/life/occasions.py) and a line in the scrapbook (dungeon/life/scrapbook.py).
Odds show under Hidden values ("Why it went this way"). No model decides anything: the model only puts it in words.
