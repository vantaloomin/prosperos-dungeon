"""Life chapters: lasting changes to the companion's life every few months, picked by the consequence engine.

Once a month, on a day seeded by the timeline, a chapter may begin: how likely is set by the drama level, never
sooner than `GAP` after the last one or `SETTLE_IN` after the timeline began. Which chapter comes from the odds
table `chapter:next` (world/data/consequences.json), read from the marks earlier outcomes left (money tight since
spring makes a new job likelier; a promotion makes a move likelier), the companion's description and what they have
(a pet already, friends in the circle). The chapter then rewrites state for good:

- `new_job`: another career the city offers on the same kind of schedule, paying the same or more (more when money
  has been tight); the budget follows.
- `move`: another neighbourhood of the city whose rents fit their pay; the home is the new place from that day.
- `pet`: a pet comes home.
- `hobby`: a pastime they take up for real joins their interests.
- `friend_moves`: a friend in the circle moves away to another city and leaves the circle.
- `relationship`: they meet someone, who joins their circle as their partner (dungeon/life/love_life.py: their own
  love life, which then moves up the steps ladder or ends by its own rolls).
- `school`, `career_change`, `buy_place` and `retire`: Life's big turns (dungeon/life/big_turns.py), which take months
  and run in stages. Life's big turns (Settings > Realism) sets how often any chapter begins.

Changes to who they are (career, location, interests) are an overlay on the character's active version for this
timeline (applied by dungeon/characters.py `with_chapters`), so a fork without the chapter keeps the old life and the
character's own description and personality are never rewritten. A chapter never touches personality, emotional
traits or a romance companion's love life (a romance companion meets someone this way only in an open
relationship; on Drama a secret is love_life.py's own roll). Today lists them with "Why it went this way" and an undo; the chat context
tells the companion for a while, and the news can open a conversation. No model decides anything.
