"""Expecting or adopting together (Hit List #73, v0.15 Room to Grow): once the user and a romance companion have
decided to start a family (dungeon/life/parenthood.py), the child comes, by the route picked for the pair.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08). Everything is planned the
day it begins, from seeds and the consequence engine (odds under Hidden values), never by a model:

- Expecting (either of them, or a surrogate in a modern city): how long it takes to find out (family:soon), then a
  pregnancy over about nine months in real time: the news, telling their people (News travels, dungeon/news.py;
  how each took it from the bank), appointments on the Life admin calendar, the nursery and baby things from their
  money (life admin costs, dungeon/life/admin.py; a shared home too small grows a size through moving_in.grow), a
  baby shower as a big day in a modern city (dungeon/life/big_days.py `own_shower`), "any day now" and the birth.
  On Real life and Drama a pregnancy can take a hard turn (family:turn): bed rest, or an early arrival. Never a loss.
- Adopting: the agency, a home study, the wait (family:wait), the match and the day the child comes home; a baby or
  an older child (family:match). Fostering: the training, the home study, a placement, and with family:fostered
  adopting them some months on. Older cities take in a ward, a foundling or a relative's child.
- The app picks the child's name (never the companion's, the persona's, someone in their circle's or a word from a
  place in their city, as families.baby_name); the companion suggests it, and the user can rename them on the
  Character page. Born or home, the child is in `circle_children` as the pair's own (title 'ours', parent_id the
  companion), where Our child picks them up.

The chat context hears it in the 'steps' section through parenthood.context_lines: what stage it is at, the latest
moment and what comes next; first texts tell the news (`news_due`). Children keep v0.14's limits: words only (the
child's name is in families.names, so no picture is made of words naming them, and the shower has no photo), never
in the circle (`circle_children`, not circle_people), and with the adult side of life on nothing of it
goes in a chat prompt, a first text, the news or the calendar (`quiet`); it stays on the screens.
