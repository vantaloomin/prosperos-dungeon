"""Everyone gets older (Hit List #67): ages move on with the calendar.

Until v0.14 nobody's age moved: a companion's came from their words ("34.", "in her thirties") or a seed, a circle
member's and a partner's were stored once, and a townsperson's was seeded. Now each person has one stored birth date
(the `birth_dates` table), worked out once from the age they had when it was first needed and their birthday, so
nobody's age jumps on the upgrade, and from then on their age goes up on each birthday. Nothing here calls a model.

- A companion: from their looks sheet's age (dungeon/world/looks.py: the Looks age the user set, else their
  identity's words, else seeded) and their birthday (the form's, else seeded by their id). When the user writes
  another age or birthday, their date is worked out again from the new words, so the form always wins. "Keeps their
  age" (the definition's `keeps_age`, on the Character page) holds them at the age they are when it goes on, for
  characters who shouldn't age; turned off again, they go on from there. A sheet that reads as under 18 has no age drawn and never
  gets a date: ages are only ever read upward from a stored adult date, and the adult side keeps reading their own
  words (dungeon/world/intimacy.py), so getting older never changes what it allows.
- A circle member or a love-life partner: from the age their row stores, and `sync` keeps that stored age current,
  so everything that reads it (storylines, their partner's line, later life chapters) sees how old they are now.
  A partner who joined the circle shares their circle row's date.
- A townsperson: rebuilt from a seed, so nothing is stored for them; their seeded age is their age on the day the
  town started getting older (the town row), and they turn a year older on each seeded birthday after it.

Every age here is a real one. Rules about how far through life someone is (odds, life chapters, health, passing
away, retiring) read their life age instead (`companion_life_age`, `person_life_age`, `town_life_age`): the same for
a human, stretched for a long-lived kind (dungeon/world/lifespans.py), so an elf of 300 is 48 in human terms.

Milestone birthdays (30, 40, 50 ...) are bigger occasions (dungeon/life/occasions.py, composer.py) and go in the
scrapbook (dungeon/life/scrapbook.py).
