"""Companions' own babies (v0.15 Room to Grow, #73): a friendship companion and their own partner start a family.

Births and growing families (dungeon/life/families.py) gave babies to the circle and left out the companion's own
partner. Now a companion who is not the user's romance, married to or living with the partner they met
(dungeon/life/love_life.py) or the spouse their sheet names, can have a baby with them, decided by rules on a
Monday like every other pregnancy in the circle: whether they want children (`wants`, from Wanting children,
dungeon/life/parenthood.py), the Growing families slider, how old they are, married or living together. A romance
companion's family is with the user, never a partner's.

How the child comes is the app's call, seeded from the pair (`route`): one of them expecting (whoever can, by their
pronouns and age), or adopting a newborn (a pair where nobody can carry, and now and then any pair in a modern city);
an older city takes in a baby to raise. It runs as a storyline like a pregnancy in the circle (`expecting`, or
`adopting`): the news with the month, something in the middle from the banks (world/data/families.json
`own_expecting`, `own_adopting`), "any day now", then the baby with their name, all told to the user as a friend
would. The child joins `circle_children` as the companion's own (`whose` 'companion', the partner as `parent_id`)
and grows up with ages.py; updates come from the parent's side (`own_baby`, `own_toddler`, `own_child`).

Being a parent changes their days, seen from outside: parental leave from work after the baby comes (`leave_days`,
read by dungeon/life/work.py), baby things and then childcare out of their money (`purchases`,
dungeon/life/money.py), a naming day at home where a best
friend is asked to be the godparent (dungeon/life/big_days.py `naming`), and now and then an evening out with their
partner while the user babysits (`babysitting`, asked in a first text, a plain yes or no in the user's first reply).

Children are words only, as in v0.14: never in pictures, and with the adult side of life on
nothing about them reaches a chat prompt, the godparent day is called off and nobody is asked to babysit.
