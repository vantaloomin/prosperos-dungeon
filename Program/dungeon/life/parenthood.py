"""Wanting children and the family step (Hit List #73, v0.15 Room to Grow): whether a companion wants children, and
"Starting a family", the step a romance takes beside its ladder once the pair lives together.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- Every companion wants children (yes), wants them someday, or not (no). Their own description says it first ("never
  wanted kids", "always wanted a big family"); otherwise the consequence engine decides it once from their age,
  warmth and description (choice family:wants), with the odds under Hidden values. A "someday" the dice picked turns
  into a yes once a baby is born in their circle (dungeon/life/families.py). The user can set it on the Character
  page. `wants` is the one place every feature reads it from.
- How a child would come for the user and a romance companion is picked by the app from the pair (family:route):
  who of the two could carry a baby (their pronouns and descriptions, the persona's gender and about), their ages,
  money and the era of the city; expecting (either partner), adopting, fostering or, where it fits, a surrogate in a
  modern city; taking in a ward, a foundling or a relative's child in an older one. The Character page shows it and
  the user can change it.
- "Starting a family" (`steps.FAMILY`) comes after moving in, married or not. It is stored with the ladder's steps
  (relationship_steps and step_asks, ladder `parenthood`), so asking and answering work as for every other step
  (dungeon/life/steps.py): once they have lived together long enough and are close enough, the engine decides how
  soon they bring it up (family:when, sooner when they want children and once married, later for "someday"), and the
  user answers yes, not yet or no in the chat. A companion who doesn't want children never brings it up; when the user
  raises it, the engine answers (family:answer), mostly no for them. Saying no to a companion who wants children can
  start a rough patch on Real life and Drama (dungeon/life/rough_patches.py, cause family_no), never on an easy life.

Children keep v0.14's limits: with the adult side of life on, none of this goes in a chat prompt and the step is not
brought up in a first text (`quiet`, as families.withheld); it stays on the screens. A companion who reads as a minor
has no family step. No model decides anything: the model only puts it in words.
