"""Time reconciliation and bounded catch-up (PRD T3–T7).

Each timeline keeps a cursor: the real instant its fictional life has been simulated through.
Reconciling compares the cursor with now. A return after a long enough gap plans one batch of
routine slots that ended inside the window, capped by the user's limits however long the absence
was, and moves the cursor to now in the same transaction. The cursor never moves backward, so a
clock rollback, a restart or a second launch can never simulate the same real interval twice.
Every event's idempotency key is its timeline plus routine slot, so a batch resumed after a crash
only finishes what it had not committed.

Generation time (`created_at`), event time (`starts_at`/`ends_at`) and the window a batch covers
are stored separately: a catch-up synthesizes missed fiction now and never claims it ran while
the app was closed (T4).

Everyone keeps living: the companions out of focus get the same batches, under the same settings and caps,
a few of them at a time in turn (`cast_turn`), so switching to one shows the days she had. Their events use
template wording only, so a long cast costs no model calls; the one in focus is phrased as before.
