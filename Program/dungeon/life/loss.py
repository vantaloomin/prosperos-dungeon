"""Loss and grief (Hit List #71, v0.14 Years Go By): people in the companion's circle and in their town can pass away,
mostly the old; the funeral is a day they go to, the grief is a long, slow mood, and the date stays an anniversary.

Off unless the user turns on Settings > Realism > Their days > People can pass away (off on every preset, Vanta
2026-10-13); the Loss slider then sets how often. The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of
User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- Who: anyone in the circle who is an adult, and townsfolk (dungeon/world/turnover.py, which already lets them pass
  away and has a newcomer take their place). Never a companion, never the user, never a child, never the companion's
  own partner, and never someone the user wrote into the character's description unless the user says they can on the
  circle list (`spared`).
- When: once a year for each person the consequence engine's `loss:passes` decides whether they pass away in the year
  ahead (Hidden values, "Why it went this way"). The odds rise steeply with age; the young have a tiny baseline; a
  parent whose care went harder (dungeon/life/health_turns.py `frail`) or who started treatment after a scare
  (the parent_health storyline) gets a decision of their own, with much higher odds. A death decided goes on a seeded
  day in that year.
- Then: they are 'late' (their circle row is removed with details `late`, so they leave every upcoming day), a caring
  turn for them ends, a funeral comes up as a big day
  (dungeon/life/big_days.py, kind 'funeral') with customs by culture and era (world/data/loss.json `customs`), the
  paper runs an obituary for someone local, and the date is an anniversary from then on.
- Grief, by rules: how deep follows who they were (a parent or sibling deepest, a friend less, someone from town
  least). Raw, then heavy, then lifting over weeks: a sad mood (dungeon/moods.py), fewer plans of their own, the odd
  memory, and one context line while it lasts.
  Grief is sadness and missing someone: its lines never read as self-harm, and the crisis check (dungeon/safety.py)
  is unchanged.
- Undo: "Bring them back" on the circle list, or changing how it went under Hidden values, undoes a death; turning the
  switch off cancels the deaths still to come (those that happened stay).

No model decides anything; the model only puts it into words.
