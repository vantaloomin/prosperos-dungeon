"""Life's big turns (Hit List #68, v0.14 Years Go By): back to school, a career change, buying a place, retirement,
and (part 2) starting a business, a health turn and caring for a parent.

They are life chapters like the others (dungeon/life/chapters.py picks them with the consequence engine, choice
`chapter:next`, from age, money, mood and the companion's own description), but each one takes months, so it runs in
stages kept on its row (`details`: the stage, the day the next one comes and the plan), moved on day by day by
`progress`. Nothing here calls a model; the companion tells the user as a friend or partner would, through the
chapter's `told` and `share` lines, which change with each stage.

- `school`: they sign up for a course from the bank (world/data/life_chapters.json, by era); classes start a week or
  two later, carved out of an evening of free time twice a week (the overlay's `study`, applied by
  dungeon/characters.py), fees are paid each term (`purchases`, through money.py), exams go on the calendar
  (dungeon/life/admin.py, source 'school') and on graduation day the class leaves their week.
- `career_change`: retraining the same way for a line of work in another sector of their city, then the new job (the
  career overlay), which Work life (dungeon/life/work.py) starts afresh.
- `buy_place`: the app picks a place their pay fits; house hunting until keys day, then the home is theirs, with a
  mortgage instead of rent and a deposit from savings. Living together it is a shared chapter: the companion raises it,
  the app picks a bigger place for both and the shared home moves there (dungeon/life/moving_in.py), the mortgage
  split like the rent was.
- `retire`: older characters only (their age from dungeon/life/ages.py). They hand in their notice; after their
  last day at work their working hours become time for a pursuit from the bank, and their pay a pension (`pay`).

- `business`, `health` and `caring`: part 2, in dungeon/life/business.py and dungeon/life/health_turns.py, which
  plug their plans, stages, costs and calendar entries in here.

Graduations and last days at work are the circle's big days to come (`big_days`, for Big days in the circle).
Life's big turns (Settings > Realism > Their days, life_settings.life_turns) sets how often any chapter begins; on
Gentle only good turns happen (Vanta 2026-10-18: "Good turns only" on an easy life), so the hard turns (`HARD`: a
health turn and caring for a parent) never come on it, and a business never stalls or folds. Undo on Today takes a turn back at
any stage, with the marks its outcomes left.
