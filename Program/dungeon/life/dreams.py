"""Dreams: overnight, the companion's day turns into a short, odd dream (Feature Hit List #31).

Some nights (a seeded roll, a few times a week at most) rules pick fragments of the day before: people they spent
time with, a place they went, the day's small moment from the Life deck (dungeon/life/deck.py) and, once the two
of you are close enough, the user when you talked that day. A fixed template mixes them with an odd touch ("at
the beach, except somehow it was on a ferry"), and money pressure or a plan they look forward to adds a last line,
the same state that feeds On her mind (dungeon/life/thoughts.py). Rarely, someone they live with says they
talked in their sleep.

No model decides anything. The dream is told to the companion the morning after (it may come up, as a dream),
listed on Today, and can become a morning text (dungeon/life/openers.py) phrased by the model only when model
phrasing is allowed; otherwise the template text is used as written. A dream never gives away a secret they keep,
is never a nightmare or sexual (whoever is in it), and uses no emotional trait they weren't given. A template is
not dreamed again within `repeat_days`. A night is decided once (`dreams`).
