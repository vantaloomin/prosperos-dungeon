"""Deterministic event composition (PRD T2, T3).

A routine slot becomes an ordinary event without any model call: the block's kind selects an
activity, the world source supplies a real place for it, and fixed templates write the summary,
caption and mood. The same slot always composes the same event, so a resumed batch is stable.
A model may later rephrase the wording, but never chooses the place, activity or facts.

Some slots are deliberately quiet: an uneventful stretch is a valid outcome, not a failure.
