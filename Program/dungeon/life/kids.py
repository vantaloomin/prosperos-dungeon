"""Companions who already have kids (Hit List #73, v0.15 Room to Grow): a single dad of two, a mom whose son Leo is
seven, a townsperson who had a baby with their partner. Children they had before the user came along.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- Their kids are read from their description (`described`): the ones it names ("her son Leo, 7", "Mia (4)") with
  their names and ages, and the ones it only counts ("single dad of two", "has three kids"), named and aged by seed.
  A son or daughter it calls grown, or 18 or over, stays an adult in their circle as before. A companion made from a
  townsperson who had a baby with their partner keeps that child (dungeon/world/couples.py `babies`). A new
  companion whose description says nothing either way may have kids anyway, at a low rate by age (the engine's
  kids:has, odds under Hidden values); never one whose description says they have none or never wanted any, never
  with Growing families at None (Vanta 2026-10-19), and never a companion who was already in the user's life before
  this came in (`settle`, `fresh`).
- Each child is a `circle_children` row with the companion as `parent_id` (so nothing that lists the circle's
  children under a circle person counts them as a niece or a friend's baby), `MARK` and the timeline as its storyline,
  aging with dungeon/life/ages.py. Words only, like every child in the circle (dungeon/life/families.py).
- Their other parent is someone in their circle: the ex the description names, the partner it names, the
  townsperson's partner, else a seeded co-parent; nobody when the description says they were widowed. Where the
  kids live (`PATTERNS`) is read from the description ("every other weekend", "shared custody", "single mom") or
  picked by the engine (kids:custody): with the companion and every other weekend at the other parent's, a week at
  each, or with the other parent and every other weekend with the companion. The weeks alternate the way a rota
  does (dungeon/life/shifts.py `monday_of`), from the week it was decided.
- Dating a parent: the kids are part of their life in the chat from the start ('kids' section), the user meets them
  with their people (dungeon/life/their_people.py, the "meeting their people" step), and once the two of them
  live together (dungeon/life/moving_in.py) the user is their step-parent.
- A circle parent the companion dates goes the same way (the v0.14 E2E note): a love-life partner past their
  twenties may come with kids of their own (`partner_kids`, dungeon/life/love_life.py; not with Growing families at
  None), listed under the partner,
  and once the companion lives with them the companion is the kids' step-parent.

The Character page's Family panel lists them, with where they live and the other parent; the user can change where
they live or take a child out of their life. Children keep v0.14's limits: words only, and with the adult side of
life on nothing about them goes in a chat prompt (families.withheld). No model decides anything.
