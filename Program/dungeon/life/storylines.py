"""Storylines: things that unfold over days in the companion's life and their circle's (realism).

"Omg, my dad just got a promotion." "I hate the new guy at work, he keeps hitting on me." "I got
drunk and kissed my best friend." Each storyline is a fixed template with a cast drawn from the
circle (or the companion's own work), and two or three beats spread over the following days. Which
storyline starts on which day, who is in it and how each beat turns out are all decided by a seed
when it starts, never by a model. Beats stay hidden until their day comes, like the agenda.

The Life setting `drama` is the slider from quiet to soap opera: it sets how often a storyline
starts, how many can run at once and how far they can go. Quiet keeps to good news; realistic adds
everyday trouble; dramatic adds health scares, feuds and secret romances; soap opera adds drunk
kisses, separations and family secrets. A companion in a romance with the user never gets a
storyline about their own love life, and one seeing someone (a partner in their circle) never gets the drunk kiss
(a partner-aware version was tried and did not read better with the real model: v0.14 follow-ups, ab-b.md).

Beats reach the chat context told to the companion as "you" (decided, never contradicted, the ending
never guessed); a settled one stays pinned for two months by its outcome, then goes to memory search.
They can open a conversation (dungeon/life/openers.py) and are listed in Today, where the user can
end one.
Text names people as they are named now, so renaming someone carries over; removing someone ends
the storylines they are in.
