"""Shifts and gigs (Hit List #74): a weekly rota for service jobs, freelance gigs with busy and dry spells.

Every career is staff, rota or freelance (its `employment` in the world data; a career without one, such as a user
city's own, is read from its words). Staff keep the same days every week, as written. Rota jobs (a bartender, a nurse,
a taxi driver) get each week's shifts rolled from their job's pattern: as many as the pattern has, one more in a
slammed week and one fewer in a slow one (dungeon/life/work.py), with evening and night work leaning to Fridays and
Saturdays. Freelancers (a photographer, a musician, a tour guide) have no fixed days: each week brings a few gigs, in
busy, steady and dry spells of a few weeks. The user can pin it on the character form (Work and money > Hours).

The week's days reach everything that reads their routine through the companion's definition: characters.py adds this
week and the weeks around it as `rota`, and routine.py's blocks follow it, so the agenda, outings, Life admin's clashes,
trips and the rest see the same shifts. A shift holds its time against plans with the user like work always has; it is
never cancelled for them. Weeks are written down once they are planned (table work_weeks), so a past week stays as it
was. Pay follows the shifts worked and gigs landed, with tips making a tipped job's pay swing a little
(money.household, through work.pay). It follows the Work life slider: Off keeps the days as written, Light swings
less, Dramatic more. Only the companion; circle and townsfolk keep their fixed days. No model is involved.
