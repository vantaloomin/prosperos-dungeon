"""Days that do not go to plan (realism: nobody's schedule is perfectly mapped out).

When a slot is written to the agenda, a seeded roll on the tables below can shift it: running late
(the slot starts later and the one before, often sleep, runs on), staying late (the slot ends later
and the next one starts later), plans falling through (a night out becomes a night in), something
coming up (free time goes to an errand) or a friend dropping by (free time becomes company, with a
circle member who is free). Most rolls are no event. The dice and tables come from Prospero's Study
(dungeon/life/chance.py), so the same slot always shifts the same way; no model is involved, and
the shift's wording is fixed text the model only phrases from.

The Life setting `day_shifts` (on by default) turns it off for new slots.
