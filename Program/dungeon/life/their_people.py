"""Meeting their people (Hit List #61, v0.13 Life Together): the family dinner or night out where the user meets the
companion's circle, and what each of them thinks of the user afterwards.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- Once a romance reaches the "meeting their people" step (dungeon/life/steps.py), a meet-up is planned a few days
  later with no question asked: dinner at their family's place when a parent or a sibling lives in town, else drinks
  with their friends; a companion with kids of their own has their friends to dinner at home instead, with the kids
  there (dungeon/life/kids.py). For a best friend, now and then (the engine's `people:night_out`, by the Relationship pace
  slider and how outgoing they are) a night out with their friends comes up too. A pair that has been together for
  years by how they know each other ("married for ten years"), or an existing pair that starts at the step, met
  everyone already: those first impressions are seeded straight away and nothing is planned.
- The companion invites the user in a first text (dungeon/life/openers.py) naming who, where and when; sending it
  books the outing (dungeon/life/outings.py), in person by v0.12's rules: never across a long distance, where it
  is on the first full day of the user's next stay with them in their city (dungeon/life/long_distance.py).
  Today's "Out together" lets the user call it off; called off, it is planned once more a few weeks later.
- Each person at the meet-up gets a seeded first impression of the user (the engine's `people:impression`: warm,
  lovely together, still making up their mind, protective or wary, by who they are to the companion and the drama
  level). It shows how they are at the table, and once the evening is over it is a circle-to-user pair that moves
  with what happens: plans kept warm it up, rough patches (dungeon/life/rough_patches.py), called-off plans and a
  breakup (dungeon/life/breakups.py) cool it. The companion passes it on now and then ("my mom keeps asking when you're coming back"), and it shows on the
  circle list.
- Afterwards someone they met may drop into a group chat with the companion as a v0.11 guest, by the Guests slider
  (dungeon/group_guests.py), knowing the user from that evening.

No new slider: the Relationship pace and Guests sliders decide. No model decides anything: the model only puts it in
words. Odds show under Hidden values ("Why it went this way").
