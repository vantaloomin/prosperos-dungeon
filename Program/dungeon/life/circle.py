"""The companion's social circle (PRD T8).

A few supporting people, assembled once per timeline from the world data and a seed, without a
model. In a known city they come from the world data's circle generator: a name from the city's
name groups, how they know the companion, an age, a home, a job with its weekly routine and a few
regular haunts; relatives may live out of town and have no routine here. Elsewhere a simpler
version picks a first name, a role and a career's routine. Their days advance through the same precomputed agenda as the companion's
(dungeon/life/agenda.py). They are fictional supporting characters: never the user, never a
real person, and never a source of facts about the user. The user can rename or remove them.

How many people depends on who the companion is: a social butterfly (outgoing, extroverted, life of
the party) gets a bigger circle with friends old and new, coworkers and both parents; a shy homebody
a smaller one. The Life setting `circle_size` overrides it, and grow() adds people to a circle that
was assembled smaller. Who knows whom inside the circle (family, coworkers, old friends) is derived
from roles and a seed by ties(), so storylines between them stay consistent.

Parents and siblings carry the companion's family name. A difference needs a marriage to explain it: a
sibling the circle records as married may go by a married name, and a companion who has married (or names
a maiden name with "née") has relatives with their birth name, or a name of their own when none is given.
Cousins may or may not share it.
