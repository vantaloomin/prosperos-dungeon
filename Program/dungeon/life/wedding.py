"""Engagement and wedding (Hit List #66, v0.13 Life Together): the proposal, the ring, planning the wedding and the day
itself.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- Once a romance has been living together long enough, the consequence engine decides when the companion proposes
  (the "engaged" step's `steps:when`, dungeon/life/steps.py, by the Relationship pace slider). It is a scripted
  evening, never a text: on the day they invite the user out to one of their favourite places (the place the two of
  them have been to most, else a date spot they like), without giving anything away (a first text,
  dungeon/life/openers.py, which books the outing), buy a ring from their own money (the city's customs and their pay
  set it) and ask over that evening, in person by v0.12's rules. The user's answer is read from the chat the way every
  step's is: yes, they are engaged; no keeps things where they were, with a rough spell; no answer counts as not yet.
  The user can propose too ("will you marry me?"); the engine decides their answer (`steps:answer`).
- The engagement plans a wedding with no question asked (`plan`): how big (the engine's `wedding:size`, from their pay,
  how outgoing they are and how many people they have), the day (months ahead by the city's customs and the pace, on
  its usual weekday), a venue in their city, a budget in its money (their share is paid from savings on the day), and
  a guest list from both circles: their family and friends, the people the user has told them about, and the user's
  other companions. It shows on the Character page's Life admin panel, where the user can move the day, pick another
  venue, change the size or leave a guest off; the planning (booking the venue, the invitations, the fittings) goes on
  the Life admin calendar as it comes up.
- The wedding is a big outing with the guests (dungeon/life/outings.py), in person, through the customs of the city's
  culture and era ("Customs" in dungeon/world/data/wedding.json): the order of the day, what they wear and the words.
  Once it is over they are married (the "married" step, an anniversary from then on); the user's best friends among
  their other companions have stood up at a wedding; there is a wedding photo on the feed (safe wording, the usual
  checks), a scrapbook page, and a notice in the town paper. Names never change unless the user edits them.

No new slider: the Relationship pace slider decides. No model decides anything: the model only puts it in words. Odds
show under Hidden values ("Why it went this way").
