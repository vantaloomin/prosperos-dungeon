"""A health turn and caring for a parent (Hit List #68, v0.14 Years Go By): Life's big turns, part 2
(dungeon/life/big_turns.py). Both are hard turns, so they never come on Gentle (Vanta 2026-10-18: good turns only on an
easy life).

- `health`: the companion has not been feeling right and the doctor sends them for tests (the results go on the
  calendar, dungeon/life/admin.py, source 'health'). On results day they are diagnosed with a long-term condition from
  the bank (world/data/life_chapters.json `conditions`, by era and age) and the engine says how it looks
  (`health:outlook`): manageable, or a harder road with check-ups twice as often and a low mood for a while. From then on
  the check-ups come round on the calendar, each with what it costs, and the kitchen follows (the overlay's `health`:
  dungeon/life/kitchen.py leaves out what they must avoid and orders in less). A few months on it is part of their
  routine and the turn ends; the condition and its check-ups stay. A companion never dies of it.
- `caring`: a parent in their circle who is getting on, or just started treatment after a scare
  (dungeon/life/storylines.py `parent_health`), needs more help. A week or two later two of their free evenings (a
  Saturday, for a parent out of town) become time at their parent's (the overlay's `caring`, an errand block themed
  'caring' that dungeon/life/composer.py fills), the parent's appointments go on the calendar and a share of their
  pay goes to the parent's care each month; the money and the worry leave marks the engine reads. Every three months the
  engine says how it is going (`caring:how`): better (the help eases off and the turn ends), the same, or harder. After a
  year it is simply part of their weeks.

Hook for Loss and grief: a parent whose care went harder is `frail`, and `end_care` closes the turn (and frees the
evenings) with a reason, such as their passing. Nothing here calls a model.
