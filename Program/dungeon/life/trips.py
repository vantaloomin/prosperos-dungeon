"""Trips and postcards (Hit List #12): now and then the companion gets out of town for a weekend.

Rules decide, seeded by the weekend, with no model. Two to three weeks ahead the app looks at each coming weekend:
a long weekend (a public holiday on the Friday or Monday) is likelier, there is a gap of several weeks between
trips, work or classes on those days rule it out, and it has to fit their budget this pay period. Where they go is
another city the app ships in the same era (a real city from a real one), within reach for the days they have and
leaning toward what they are interested in, or the city a relative who lives out of town is in. They go alone, with
someone from their circle, or to stay with that relative.

The destination's city pack fills the days: in the companion's agenda (dungeon/life/agenda.py) each waking slot of
a trip day is spent at a real place there, with a landmark or two among them, the first slot is setting off and the
last is heading home, which can leave them tired or, after a sunny beach weekend, sunburnt (dungeon/life/body.py).
The trip's cost comes out of their budget on the day they leave (money.household). Their texts are a little slower
while they are away (their blocks are out-and-about time, dungeon/life/pacing.py) and their status says where they
are. On the first afternoon they send the user a postcard: a first text (dungeon/life/openers.py) with a picture
postcard of the landmark when pictures in chat are on.
