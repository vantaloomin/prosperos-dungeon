"""The Life deck and random tables: small moments in the companion's days (Feature Hit List #33 and #35).

Their days pick up small surprises: a changed habit, an old joke coming back, a favor for a neighbor, a late bus.
Each of their days, the seeded dice (dungeon/life/chance.py, from Prospero's Study) decide whether something
small happens and, if so, which card it is. The cards come from two places that share one picker: the Life deck
(world/data/life_deck.json), and Study's d100 random tables reworded for everyday life
(world/data/random_tables.json), whose rows join the deck as extra cards weighted by their dice ranges. This adapts
the idea of Study's Inspiration decks, not its code: there is no deck editor, versions or packs.

The drama level (Settings > Life) sets how often a moment turns up and which cards can: quiet keeps to the
gentle ones. A card that needs someone from the circle or a job is left out for a companion without one, a card
drawn in the last `repeat_days` steps aside so the weeks don't repeat, and a card that could give away a secret
the companion keeps is never drawn. No model decides anything: the chat context tells the companion what happened
("You found a forgotten twenty in an old coat pocket"), the model only puts it in their words, and a card with a
`share` line may become a first message (dungeon/life/openers.py).

A day's draw is written once (`life_moments`), so the last week reads back as it was. Today lists it with its odds
under "Why it went this way" (with Hidden values > odds on), where the user can make it go another way: another
card, or nothing at all. Names are filled in when shown, so renaming someone carries over.
