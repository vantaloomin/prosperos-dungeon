"""Births and growing families (Hit List #70, v0.14 Years Go By): babies arrive in the circle and the companion
becomes an aunt, uncle or godparent.

A sibling, cousin, friend or coworker in the circle aged 24 to 42 may start expecting: a seeded roll each week, more
likely for a married sibling, at the pace of Realism > Their days > Growing families (`growing_families`, 0 none to
3 lots). A pregnancy runs as a storyline over months (dungeon/life/storylines.py `expecting`, which took over the
old one-line cousin_baby): the news with a due date, something halfway through, "any day now", then the birth with
the baby's name. Everything about it is decided by the seed the day the news comes, never by a model.

The baby joins the circle as a child (`circle_children`) the day they are born, with that birthday, and gets older
with it (dungeon/life/ages.py). A sibling's baby is the companion's niece or nephew, a close friend often asks the
companion to be the godparent, a cousin's or a coworker's baby is theirs. The companion babysits now and then and
hears how they are getting on (bank lines in world/data/families.json by age, storylines again), until they turn
13. A child's first birthday is a party at their parent's, a big day the companion goes to (dungeon/life/big_days.py
`first_birthdays`).

Children are words only. They are never circle_people, so nothing that reads the circle (the agenda, pictures, group
chats, love lives, the web of who knows whom) ever sees them; they are listed under their parent. With the
adult side of life on, nothing about them goes in a chat prompt (`withheld`), and no picture is made of words that
name one or their first birthday (`pictured`).

A companion's own baby with their partner (v0.15) is dungeon/life/own_family.py: their partner is never cast here,
and their own children (`whose` 'companion') get updates from the parent's side.
