"""Home upkeep: the laundry, the dishes and the clutter, and the big clean on a day off (v0.10 #25).

Three kinds of mess build up day by day from the companion's week, without a model: more laundry and clutter on
work days, dishes from the meals they cook at home (`meals_cooked`), a little extra from each pet (`pets_at_home`),
nothing while they are away on a trip and a suitcase of laundry when they get back. Each companion has a seeded habit
from the words that describe them (neat, average or messy) that sets how much they let build up before dealing with
it, and how often they deal with it on a work day. Once the mess passes their habit's limit, a day off brings a big
clean, never on a day with a plan with the user (it waits for the next day off).

Each day is walked from the one before with seeded dice, and days before their today are kept once walked
(upkeep_days), so what already happened never changes and the days ahead follow from it. The user can set how tidy
the place is today ("Set it"); the walk starts again from there and drifts with their week. The realism slider
(life_settings.upkeep_realism) turns it off, or makes mess lighter or heavier.

What happened shows up as one sentence woven onto an at-home agenda entry (`touch`, called once from
dungeon/life/agenda.py), as plain lines in the chat's home section (`context_lines`), in pictures at home when an
area is a real mess (`image_hint`) and on the Character page's Home panel (`view`). Life admin reads the big cleans
and wash days ahead through `chores_between`.
