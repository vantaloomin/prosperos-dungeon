"""Go somewhere together (Hit List #10): plans with the user play out at real places.

Rules decide and the model only phrases. When the user asks the companion out ("dinner Friday?", "want to go to
Lupa this weekend?", the map's "Suggest going together" line), the app settles it before the reply is written: the
companion says yes, on the day asked when they are free then and otherwise on the nearest free day, at the time
asked or a usual one for the outing, and picks a real place in their city that fits it, their tastes and what they
can spend this pay period. A place the user named is kept. A firm plan the companion makes in their own reply
("let's get drinks Saturday") is settled the same way when that day is free. Nothing asks the user first; Today's
"Out together" lets them call it off, send the companion's pick somewhere else, or head home early.

The plan takes its slot in the companion's agenda (dungeon/life/agenda.py) the way their own plans do, so their
day holds it and the life simulation tells it as an event. While it is under way the chat context says they are out
together in person, with the place, the spot inside it, dishes and prices from the city data and the weather (the
"together" section, shared with trips). When it ends the bill comes out of their budget (money.household), a memory
of it is kept, and with pictures in chat on a photo of it is made for the feed post its event joins.

An outing belongs to the message it came from, like a plan the companion made (dungeon/life/own_plans.py): it
holds on every timeline showing that message or a copy, and goes when the message does.
