"""Absence mood: a visible, resettable relationship state (PRD C6, M4).

When the user comes back after a long gap and the character has an absence trait (see
`dungeon/traits.py`), a mood record says so, with the trait's own intensity. The
length of the absence never raises the intensity above the trait, never adds work and never
touches product controls. Without such a trait nothing is recorded and the return is warm.
A mood applies only while the active character still has a qualifying trait, so removing the
trait stops it from the next reply. The user can reset it at any time.
