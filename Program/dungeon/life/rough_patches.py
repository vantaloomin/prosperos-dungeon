"""Rough patches and making up (Hit List #63, v0.13 Life Together): a falling-out that lasts until it is mended.

What opens one, all caught by rules from what the app already knows:
- words that sting, aimed at them (`STINGS`, a narrower list than the one moods.py reads);
- an agreed plan with a date passing without a word, or their birthday or your anniversary going unmentioned
  (dungeon/life/reactions.py notices both);
- a secret coming out: you told someone what they trusted you with, or they found out you kept something from them
  (dungeon/secrets.py);
- a broken promise: "I'll call you tonight" said in the chat, and no word from you by then (`rough_patch_promises`);
- calling off an outing on its own day (small friction, gone in a day);
- finding out you're seeing someone else once you two are exclusive (`seeing_someone`, called by Next steps), never
  on an easy life;
- small everyday friction other features report through `friction`.

Whether something you did starts a rough patch is a roll in the consequence engine (choice user:rough_patch in
world/data/consequences.json): odds from the Rough patches slider (life_settings.rough_patches_realism: 0 off,
1 easy, 2 real life, 3 dramatic), what happened, an emotional trait the user built that speaks to it, their own
description (forgiving, holds on to things) and how close they are. The odds stay under Hidden values ("Why it went
this way" on Today, with show_odds), where the user can also make it go the other way. One over the same thing as a
rough patch already open (or one that started that day) is less likely, a half for the second, a quarter for the third
(`stacked_on`).

The companion can be the one at fault: on Real life and Drama they now and then call off an outing with you at the
last minute (`stand_ups`), and then apologise first.

It lasts until mended: an apology the app recognises from fixed phrases (data/rough_patches/apologies.json), a
make-up gesture (a gift or kind act in the chat, data/rough_patches/gestures.json; or an outing or visit with you
that happens), or enough calm days. On an easy life it fades overnight; on real life an apology or a gesture mends
it, or a few calm days; on drama it lingers for two weeks unless you make up, and something serious (a secret, being
with someone else) needs both an apology and a gesture. When they were at fault, it mends when you accept their
apology (data/rough_patches/accepting.json), when the next plan together happens, or after a calm day or two.

While one is open, one line in the chat notes ('patch') says what it is about and how it colors their replies. The
Character page says "Things are a bit tense"; with Hidden values > moods it also says what about, and offers Let it
go.
