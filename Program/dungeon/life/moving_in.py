"""Moving in together (Hit List #62, v0.13 Life Together): one home for a couple, once they reach the moving-in step.

The step itself is the steps ladder's (dungeon/life/steps.py): the companion brings it up, or the user does, and yes
reaches it. From then on the app decides the rest ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08), and the user
can make it go another way under Hidden values:

- In the same city, whose place: the user's, theirs, or a new one, from how big their place is, what each costs, how
  far each is from their work, and whose pets live where (choice `moving_in:where`). The move takes a few weeks.
- In different cities, who moves, as the companion's question and never forced on the user (Vanta 2026-10-13, choice
  `moving_in:who`): they move to the user's city, odds from how rooted they are (family and friends around them, a job
  that is hard to leave), and it is a life chapter like any other (a new job in the user's city, the coworkers left
  behind, the user's city's clock); or they ask the user to move to theirs, and the user changes their home city
  themselves on the persona form. Until one of them moves they stay long distance.

Once moved in there is one shared home: the companion's home on the Character page is it, the user's neighbourhood is
its neighbourhood (`shared_home`, read by dungeon/life/where.py), and rent is split through dungeon/life/money.py
(`split`). Chores and cooking go by whose turn it is (`turn`, rules only). Evenings when they are both home count as
Together (dungeon/life/together.py), so the chat is written in person then and texted while either of them is out;
the user saying they are out, or Heading out on the chat strip, makes it texting for a while (`out_until`).

Moving out (`move_out`) comes after a breakup (Breaks and breakups) or the step taken back on the Character page: the one
who moved in moves out, picked by rules, and stays in town. When the user moves to another city they move out: whoever set the home up
keeps it, and a home grown for more of them is given up a few months on for a one-bedroom (`downsize`). No model decides anything: the model only puts it in words.

Sharing a home (Vanta's item 1, v0.13): when another romance companion's moving-in step is reached while the user lives
with someone (or is about to), the newcomer would move into that home. Everyone involved says whether they are open to
sharing it, one roll each in the consequence engine (choice `moving_in:share`, from an open-relationship interest, their
personality sliders, a trait like jealous or possessive, a rough patch over the user seeing someone else, the drama
level), and the one already living there hears about it (a line in the chat, and a first text). Everyone open: the
newcomer moves in on their own moving day, into the same home (`household`, grown to fit everyone: `grow`), the rent
split among everyone and the chores taking turns among everyone. Anyone not open: the move waits, asked again some
weeks later, and a small rough patch can open with the one who isn't ready. The user can make any of the rolls go the other way under Hidden values.
