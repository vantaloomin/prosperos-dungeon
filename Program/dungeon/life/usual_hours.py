"""When the user is usually around, learned from when they start conversations.

Rules only, no model and nothing stored: the user's own messages from the last four weeks, in the user's
timezone, split into weekdays and weekends. A message counts when the user starts an exchange (nothing in
the conversation for a while before it, and not an answer to a text the companion started, so the
companion's own first texts never teach it the hours). A half hour is usual when the user started a
conversation in it on enough different days; neighbouring usual half hours join into one stretch.
The app never shows these hours anywhere; they only decide when the companion might reach out.
