"""Big days in the circle (Hit List #69, v0.14 Years Go By): weddings, milestone birthdays, retirement parties and
graduations in the companion's circle and town become days they go to, with the user as their plus-one; and a
friendship companion's own wedding is a big day with the user standing up at it.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08):

- Where big days come from (`SOURCES`, checked once a day): a sibling's engagement storyline (sibling_engaged in
  dungeon/life/storylines.py) sets a wedding date for next year; friends in their circle get engaged and marry in
  seeded years, more often with the Their love life slider up; a parent, sibling, cousin or old friend turning 30, 40,
  50 ... has a party (dungeon/life/ages.py); a working relative reaching their seeded retirement age has a send-off;
  a circle member studying graduates in late spring; a townsperson the companion knows well marries
  (dungeon/world/couples.py); a friend's own engagement (dungeon/life/love_life.py) plans their wedding; and a
  baby in their circle turning one has a party at their parent's (dungeon/life/families.py). Children are words
  only: the parent is the one there, there is no photo, no buzz, and with the adult side of life on there is no party.
  Later features add their own kinds (`KINDS`) and big days (`add`): graduations from life chapters, funerals.
- Whether they ask the user along is the consequence engine's `bigday:invite` (the Guests slider, how close they are,
  family or not, a romance), under Hidden values ("Why it went this way"). Asked or not, they go: a gift bought from
  their own money a week before (the bank's gifts for the kind, priced by their pay, through money.household), an
  outfit from their wardrobe (dungeon/life/wardrobe.py), and the day itself.
- The invitation is a first text (dungeon/life/openers.py) naming whose day it is, the day, the time and the place;
  sending it books the day as an outing (dungeon/life/outings.py, activity 'big-day'), in person with the circle
  there. Living in different cities, the user can't come and they go on their own. An out-of-town relative's
  day is in the city they live in (trips.hometown): the user comes along when a trip from the city they share
  reaches it, and either way the companion travels there (the fare from their money, a line saying so).
- The invitation never lands on a day an outing with the user already has: a party or a wedding moves a week on, a
  day that is its own (a graduation, a funeral) isn't asked to. Only days the user said yes to (or is still to
  answer) keep another from being asked within INVITE_GAP; after a no, the next one is weighed again.
- Saying no is fine and remembered: a no in the user's first reply to the invitation, or "Can't make it" on Today,
  and they go on their own with no hard feelings; the chat context keeps it.
- In a modern city the days before and after carry a line of group chat buzz from the bank for them to pass on.
- Afterwards a sibling or a friend is married, a relative retired and a student graduated (their circle row), the
  user keeps a memory of the day, and with pictures in chat on there is a photo (outings.py: safe wording, the usual
  checks). A friend's own wedding makes them married to their partner and, with the user there as their best friend,
  reaches the friendship ladder's last step (dungeon/life/steps.py "Stood up at their wedding").

No new slider: Guests and Their love life decide. No model decides anything: the model only puts it in words.
