"""Precomputed schedules for the companion and their circle (PRD T4, T8, T9).

Each subject's routine is expanded a rolling week ahead and composed without a model, seeded by
the slot, so filling in a long absence at once and advancing a few slots at a time on a running
server write the same entries. Upcoming entries stay hidden; when their slot ends they become
`happened`, or `skipped` when a pause covers them. An entry records the character version or
person revision it was built from, and upcoming entries built from an older one are rebuilt.

For the companion, the agenda is scaffolding: what they did becomes part of their account only
through reviewed life events, which the capped batches (T5) draw from these entries. Circle
members' happened entries are their visible diary.
