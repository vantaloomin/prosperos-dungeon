"""When families change (Hit List #73, v0.15 Room to Grow): a breakup or a move with children shared, and the parents
the world spares while their baby is small.

The app decides, the user overrides ("the world exists outside of User", Vanta 2026-10-08). Rules and seeds only, no
model:

- A breakup with children of the pair (dungeon/life/our_child.py) means shared custody. Where the children live is
  the engine's `family:custody`, read from who was home with them, who carried them, the companion's work and whether
  the two of them now live in different cities: mostly with the companion (every other weekend with the user), half
  and half (a week each, turn and turn about), or mostly with the user (every other weekend with the companion). The
  weeks alternate the way a rota does (dungeon/life/shifts.py `monday_of`), from the week it ended. The user can
  set it on the Character page (for that breakup: getting back together and splitting again starts from
  the app's pick), or change how it went under Hidden values. The children go on in words in both
  lives: on Today and the Character page, and in the companion's texts, where they are and whose week it is. Getting
  back together ends it. Never on an easy life, which has no breakups (dungeon/life/breakups.py).
- Long distance with a child (dungeon/life/long_distance.py): the children stay with the parent they live with
  (the companion, unless custody gave them to the user), and the weekend visits are when the other one sees them.
- A companion and their own partner (dungeon/life/own_family.py) who split with a child: the ex stays in their
  circle as the child's other parent, and where the child lives is the engine's kids:custody, as for kids they had
  before (dungeon/life/kids.py).
- Loss (dungeon/life/loss.py): children are never the one who passes away, nor the pair's grown child; a parent
  with a baby under one, or one on the way, is spared until the baby turns one, and the other parent of a child the
  companion shares with them (an ex co-parent, the kids' other parent) until the child is 18 (Vanta 2026-10-19).

Children keep v0.14's limits everywhere: words only, and with the adult side of life on a reply carries the family
lines or the adult side's, never both (our_child.quiet).
