"""Pets with lives of their own (Hit List #15): sick days, vet visits, growing old and, rarely, dying.

Everyone can have pets: the companion (their home's pets, dungeon/life/home.py), the people in their circle
and the townsfolk (seeded, so the same person always has the same pet) and the user's persona (only the pets
the user writes in, never invented). Rules decide everything from a seed and the bank in world/data/pets.json,
with no model: what kind of pet suits the city's era, its name and looks, when it was born, how long its kind
lives, and day by day whether it falls sick, sees the vet for that or for its yearly checkup, or dies.

A pet's life is written to `pet_log` once as the days pass (`evolve`), so the past stays put when a Realism
setting changes. The Realism tab scales it: `pets_realism` (0 off, 1 light, 2 true to life, 3 dramatic) sets how
often pets fall ill and for how long, and `pets_can_die` lets a pet die of old age, or of a serious illness late
in life. A young pet never dies, and on I want an easy life none do. A pet the user brings back after it died is
spared from then on.

Other modules read pets through this module: home.py weaves sick days, vet visits and deaths into the
companion's days and chat context, trips.py asks who minds the pets (`minders`), money.py counts vet bills and
sitters (`purchases`), Life admin lists vet visits (`vet_visits`), and the image prompts draw a pet with its
looks line (`picture_line`), never with words about illness.
