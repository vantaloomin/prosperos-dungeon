"""Money and budget: what the companion earns, what rent takes, and what is left until payday.

Everything is computed from static data, with no model call and no stored state: the career's pay
tier (dungeon/world/data/careers.json), the home city's rents, prices and currency, and the
character's own money setup. The same character and date always give the same budget, splurge,
surprise bill and savings progress. The model only phrases what is listed here.

`affordable(definition, activity_key, local_date)` is the composer's one hook: on a tight day an
outing that costs money gives way to a free one. Settings with no money (Oz) or no known city
leave every activity affordable.
