"""On their mind: one private thought a day, shown folded on Today (Feature Hit List #8).

At the end of each of the companion's days (from `EVENING` their time) the app works out what is on their mind from
what actually happened that day, all by rules: a storyline beat or a new chapter of their life, how an outcome left
them feeling, money (payday, a tight week, a surprise bill), a plan they are looking forward to, a day that went off
plan, the user's closeness reaching a new stage or simply that the two of you talked. The weightiest topic wins (a
tie goes to the day's seeded dice), a topic used on either of the two days before steps aside when there is anything
else, and a fixed template words it. The model only polishes the wording, in the background, when background
activity and model phrasing are both on; a polish that drops the name is thrown away.

A thought is written once per day and kept (`thoughts`), so the last week reads back as it was. It never appears
in chat and the companion never learns it was read. Limits: nothing a secret they keep could give away, and thoughts
about the user stay light: no reactions, and never an emotional trait the character wasn't given.
