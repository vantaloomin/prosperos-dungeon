"""Replies at the companion's pace (realism: people answer later, or briefly, when they are busy).

The companion decides, not the user: replies are never locked. Their status line may show an away message
from the same blocks ("at work till 6", dungeon/life/status.py) as a hint, never an online dot. With the Life
setting `paced_replies` on (the default), a reply to a message sent while they are at work or out
is, by a seeded choice, one of: written now but shown later (8 to 45 minutes at work, 5 to 25 out,
never past the end of the block), a quick holding text now ("in a meeting, give me a bit") with the
full reply later as a message of its own, or a quick short note now instead of a real conversation.
The holding text stays in the conversation. If the user writes again before the full reply shows,
that reply is dropped unseen and the answer to the new message becomes the full reply, at the same
time, so it takes in everything they said meanwhile. Asleep, the reply shows
when they wake. A reply that shows at once also shows any earlier one still held, and a reply held
while an earlier one is waiting shows no sooner than it. What counts is the companion's precomputed
day (a holiday or a sick day is not work), else their routine.
