"""On a call (Hit List #59, v0.12 Where you are): talking on the phone, started by either side.

A call is the third state a companion can be in with the user, beside apart and together (dungeon/life/together.py).
Rules start and end it; the model never decides it.

The user calls them: the Call button in the chat header, or words like "can I call you?" and "call me?". They pick up
when they are free (not at work, out, or asleep); otherwise they don't, and the reply to those words says why, or for
the button, they text back once they are free ("sorry, missed your call, I was at work").

They call the user: now and then, as often as the Getting together slider says (more for someone far away, since calls
carry long distance), a companion who is comfortable with the user rings. The strip shows it for a few minutes with
Answer and Decline; writing in the chat answers it too. A call nobody answered becomes a first text later ("tried
calling you!"). Rings come with first texts (dungeon/life/openers.py), so quiet hours, their sleep and the gap after
the last message all hold them back.

On a call the same chat is the call: replies are written as spoken words, texting habits stop (no held replies, bursts
or typos) and, when a voice is set up for voice notes (dungeon/voice/notes.py), each reply is also read aloud. It
ends with End call, a goodbye in the chat, ten quiet minutes, or on its own when they have to go (work, class,
bedtime: together.end_of_visit), when they say so first.
