"""Family traditions and a seasonal home (Hit List #24): their family has its ways.

Thanksgiving is always at their mom's in Towson, and the decorations go up and come down with the seasons. Both
are decided by rules and a seed, never by a model, from dungeon/world/data/traditions.json:

- traditions: a few holidays from the city's calendar (dungeon/world/data/holidays.json), always its biggest
  family ones, each with a host from the circle (a parent first, then a sibling or a cousin; a friend for a
  night out like New Year's Eve), a dish and a ritual. Seeded once per timeline, after the circle exists; the
  user can reword one, drop it, bring it back or add their own. Text is kept with a {their} token so the same
  line reads "their mom" on the Character page and "your mom" in the chat context.
- decorations: what is up at home today, from the season windows below and a seeded keenness (some people go
  all out, some only put up a tree, a few never bother). Nothing is stored; the date decides.

They show in the occasions part of the chat context and on Today when a holiday is a week away or less
(dungeon/life/occasions.py), as the companion's day on the holiday itself (dungeon/life/agenda.py), and
the decorations in the home section of the context and in pictures taken at home.
