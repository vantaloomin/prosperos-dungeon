"""Townsfolk personality sliders (dungeon/world/personality.py) and the user's changes to them.

Every townsperson's sliders are rolled from their sheet; the user can change any of them on the person's profile

townsfolk), so every companion living in that town meets the same person, and carry over when the townsperson
becomes a companion (dungeon/cast.py).
