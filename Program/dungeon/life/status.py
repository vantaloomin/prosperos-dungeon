"""Status messages (Hit List #51): a line the companion "sets" for themselves, like an old AIM away message.

The app writes it from their life with rules and templates, and no model: a new chapter or a storyline
beat they would share, payday, how they feel, a plan coming up, else an everyday line drawn from who
they are. It is drawn once per half day (local morning and afternoon), so it changes at most twice a day,
except when something big happens.

While they are asleep, at work or out, a short in-character away line from the block they are in shows
instead ("at work till 6", "zzz"), with a glyph for the kind of block. It never locks the chat and never
reflects the user: it is only a hint, like a real person's away message (presence rule, Vanta 2026-10-10).
There are still no online or idle dots, read receipts or typing indicators.

The user can set the status. Their line stays until something big happens in the companion's life (a new
chapter or a storyline beat after it was set); a cleared line lets the app pick again. Lines only use what
the companion would share, so a secret never shows.

While the chat style is Retro IM, the everyday and away lines come from a bank of 2000s away messages instead
(world/data/retro_status.json): fake-deep lines, a song on repeat, sparkly emo when they feel low, random
inside jokes, and era-style away lines. Big events, payday, sick days and plans still show as usual.

Song lyrics are not in the app (it is public). A person can keep their own in retro-lyrics.txt in the data folder,
one per line; when it has any, quoted lyrics join the mix. The file stays on their computer and is never shared.
