"""How a companion takes what the user did, through the consequence engine (dungeon/consequences.py).

Only four things count, each one the app can tell happened without guessing: the user telling someone a secret in
a group chat, an agreed plan with a date passing with no message from the user that day, the user chatting on the
companion's birthday or a first-talk anniversary without mentioning it, and the user adding someone to a group with
"show everything". Each is a choice in the odds tables (`user:*`): how likely it is to sting comes only from an
emotional trait the user built into the character whose name speaks to it (`MINDS`), so without one she lets it go.
A sting leaves a mood mark for a few days that the chat context tells her as "you", so she can bring it up once in
her own words; it never cools closeness. Odds show only in "Why it went this way" and out-of-character answers.
