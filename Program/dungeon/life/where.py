"""Where you are (Hit List #59): the user's own home, and how far it is from each companion's.

Every persona has a home in each of their worlds: a city and a neighbourhood, kept on the world in worlds.json
(dungeon/worlds.py) and copied into the world's persona row for the prompt. The app picks it and the user can change
it on the persona form: a world's home starts in the world's city, in a neighbourhood picked the way a companion's is
(seeded, from the rent tiers, dungeon/life/money.py), and a city the user picks follows the same travel rules as
trips (dungeon/life/trips.py fits: a made-up world's persona lives in that world).

`between` is the helper the rest of Where you are builds on (together or apart, calls, long distance): whether a
companion lives in the user's city or is long distance, and how far apart the two of them are. A companion whose city
can't be told but whose time zone differs from the user's city's is long distance too (Vanta's decision "Time zone
decides", v0.13), placed by their own words for where they live, else by their time zone's city.
