"""Starting a business (Hit List #68, v0.14 Years Go By): one of Life's big turns, part 2 (dungeon/life/big_turns.py).

The engine picks it like any chapter (`chapter:next`, likelier for the driven and with money coming in). The app picks
the business from the bank (world/data/life_chapters.json `businesses`, by era) and when it opens; until then they
keep their job. On opening day what it took to set up comes out of their savings (`purchases`), their working hours
become the business's (the overlay's `business`, applied by dungeon/characters.py), Work life steps aside
(dungeon/life/work.py `works`) and their pay is what the business makes (`pay`, a share of their old pay that starts
lean). Every three months the consequence engine says how it went (`business:how`): it grows, ticks along, stalls or
folds. Growing and stalling move what it makes; folding closes it, they live on a little while they look for work, then
go back to their old line of work. On Gentle a business never stalls or folds (Vanta 2026-10-18: good turns only on an
easy life; v0.15: a stall is a hard turn too).
After two years open it is simply how they make a living, and the turn ends there. Nothing here calls a model.
