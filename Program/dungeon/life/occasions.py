"""Birthdays and anniversaries (realism: real people remember the date).

Three kinds of day, all from saved state and the calendar, never from a model:

- the companion's own birthday: the definition's `birthday` ("MM-DD") or, when it is empty, a date
  seeded by the companion's id. On the day a free evening goes to celebrating, with a friend from
  the circle when one is free (dungeon/life/composer.py). A milestone (30, 40, 50 ...: dungeon/life/ages.py)
  is a bigger one: the line names it, Today says it and the evening is a party.
- the user's birthday: the Life setting `user_birthday`, filled in the first time the user says it
  in their own words ("my birthday is March 3rd", "it's my birthday today") and editable or
  clearable in Settings. It is never guessed.
- a circle member's birthday (dungeon/life/circle.py, seeded by their id): their mom, sister or friends.
  It is the companion's news, not the user's, so it carries no hint to wish anyone and opens no conversation;
  on the day the companion may celebrate with them (dungeon/life/composer.py).
- a family tradition (dungeon/life/traditions.py): a holiday their family keeps, with how they keep it.
- a step in the relationship (dungeon/life/steps.py): a year since they became exclusive, two since moving in.
- the day someone in their circle died, a year or more on (dungeon/life/loss.py): on the day only, with no first text.
- how long the two have been talking: a month, three months, six months, a hundred days, then each
  year, counted from the timeline's first message. For a romance it is their anniversary.

The chat context gets the day itself and what is coming within a week; on the day, the companion
can open the conversation with it (dungeon/life/openers.py).
