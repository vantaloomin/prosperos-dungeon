"""Long distance (Hit List #59, v0.12 Where you are): a companion whose city isn't the user's.

Living in different cities (dungeon/life/where.py `between`), they can't just meet up or come over: drop-in visits,
outings and invitations over stay with companions in the user's city (dungeon/life/together.py, outings.py). Instead,
now and then, a weekend visit is planned the way their own trips are (dungeon/life/trips.py, a trip row with `visit`
set): they come to stay with the user ('to-you') or the user comes to stay with them ('host'), picked by money and
vacation days. Vacation days around the weekend mean they have the time to travel; otherwise the two take turns; and
when they can't afford the fare this pay period, the user comes to them. Cities beyond a trip's reach get rarer,
longer visits (Thursday to Monday, when they are off those days), and calls carry the rest (dungeon/life/calls.py
rings more for them). How often follows the Getting together slider (life_settings.together_realism): never on their
own at 0, and a visit asked for in the chat ("come visit me?", "can I come see you next weekend?") is settled the same
way at any level: the weekend asked, or the next free one, and when none works the reply says why. Split up with a
child under 18, it is settled as coming to see the child that weekend, not a stay with each other (`for_the_child`).

They tell the user about a visit the app planned (a first text, dungeon/life/openers.py). While it is under way they
are together in person (together.state, 'staying' or 'hosting'): the chat writes face to face, nothing is held, nobody
texts first or rings. Afterwards it is kept as a shared memory. The user can call one off before it starts (Today).

The time difference shows in when they text: their days follow their own clock and the user's quiet hours hold their
first texts, and the 'where' section tells the model how far apart they are and how many hours.
