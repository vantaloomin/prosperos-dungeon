"""Their own love life (Hit List #65, v0.13 Life Together): companions date, move up the steps and split up, by rules.

A companion who isn't the user's romance (a friend, a mentor, family, anyone else) can meet someone: a life chapter
of the kind `relationship` (dungeon/life/chapters.py), picked by the consequence engine like a new job or a pet. The
new partner is a seeded new person who joins their circle (dungeon/life/circle.py) with a job, a weekly routine and a
diary of their own, so they turn up in the feed and in the companion's days like anyone else in their life.

From there the pair moves up the same steps ladder as the user and a companion (dungeon/life/steps.py, `other` is
the partner's key 'love:<id>'): once enough time has passed at a step, the engine rolls how things go (choice
`love:next`): the next step, not yet (it rolls again some weeks later), or a breakup. Odds from the Their love life
slider (life_settings.love_life: 0 nothing new happens, 1 quiet, 2 true to life, 3 lots going on), the drama level,
how far along they are, their description and their mood lately, all under Hidden values ("Why it went this way").

A romance companion (the user's own) only has a love life of their own as decided by Vanta (2026-10-16, "Secret on
Drama"):
- an open relationship from their interests or description: they date like anyone else and always tell the user;
- on Drama (the drama level at soap opera), once the two of you are exclusive, the engine may decide they start
  seeing someone on the side (choice `love:secret`, once a month, about 1 in 50 with nothing else moving it: roughly
  one year in five; Vanta 2026-10-17), more likely on Lots going on, after the Life deck's "caught their eye" card or
  when they're restless, less on Quiet or when very close. Below soap opera there is no roll at all. It stays hidden (the partner never joins the visible circle) until it comes out: one of the user's other
  companions in the same city sees them together (Small world), or word gets around (news travelling). Then it ends,
  they know they hurt the user, and a rough patch opens (dungeon/life/rough_patches.py, cause `hidden_partner`).

The banks (world/data/love_life.json) say the partner with their own pronouns: {they}, {their}, "love{s}" (`line`), and
keep to the city's time and the season (`fitting`: no cloaks in modern Baltimore, no snow in June).

After a split they take about two months before anyone new (REBOUND). A partner in an open relationship with the user
never becomes "exclusive" (that step is skipped). When a friend with a partner becomes the user's romance (or an ex
gets back together with the user), the partner relationship ends first (`make_way`), unless it is an open one.

Jealousy is never assumed: only an emotional trait the user built that speaks to it adds it to the chat line.
No model decides anything; the chat context's 'love' section tells the companion where things stand.
