"""Kitchen and food (Hit List #19): what the companion eats, cooks and runs out of.

A light pantry, not an inventory. Once per timeline, without a model, the companion gets a seeded way of eating from
who they are: a diet (most eat everything; some are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian, always when their description
says so), things they avoid (an allergy or not eating pork, only from their description or the user), a cooking
skill (from can't really cook to a serious cook: a line cook or someone who loves cooking is a good one), whether they
love baking, and a few dishes they make a lot. Dishes come from banks per era and cuisine
(dungeon/world/data/kitchen/*.json, 110+ specific dishes each): their city decides which.

Each evening's meal is drawn, not stored: the same timeline, date, day and settings always give the same dinner, so
the agenda, the chat, the panel and the budget agree. A seeded weekly rhythm (cook, leftovers from a big batch,
takeout, keeping it simple) leans on their skill, how busy the day is (a long shift means takeout or something
quick), how they feel (a cold means something simple), what money is left this pay period (tight means cooking) and
the season. What their day already holds wins: a "cooked at home" entry is a cooking night, dinner out with a friend
or with the user is dinner out, and dinner at their place with the user (outings.py, `dinner-in`) is them cooking
for you. A few staples (coffee, eggs, milk; tea and bread in London; ale in Camelot) last a seeded number of days
after each grocery run and run out until the next one.

The Realism tab's kitchen slider (life_settings.kitchen_realism: 0 off, 1 light, 2 true to life, 3 dramatic) scales the
ups and downs: off, staples never run out and nothing goes wrong; light (I want an easy life) never runs out either
and a dinner rarely goes wrong; higher settings make staples run out sooner and now and then a dinner goes sideways
(and they order in instead).

Other modules read it through `touch` (the agenda), `context_lines` (the chat's "kitchen" section), `purchases`
(takeout counts as spending in money.household), `cooked` (Home upkeep's dishes), `grocery_runs` (Life admin's
Today), `hosting` (dinner at their place) and `invite_due` (they ask the user over). The user can change the diet,
what they avoid, the skill, baking and favourite dishes on the Character page; the days ahead follow.
