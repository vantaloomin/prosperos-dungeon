"""Life admin calendar (Hit List #23): the boring stuff happens too.

The dentist every six months, the car inspection, the lease renewal and taxes in April, plus the week's errands and
paperwork, all decided without a model. What comes due follows the city's country and era
(dungeon/world/data/life_admin.json, keyed by the city's holiday calendar): taxes are due April 15 in the US and
March 15 in the 1920s, Japan has a residence tax notice in June, a car needs its MOT in London and its smog check in
Los Angeles, and Victorian London pays rent on the quarter days. A city with no cars has no car inspection, and nobody
files taxes in Camelot. The week's errands and paperwork are seeded draws from the banks in the same file, and on
Bring on the drama a surprise now and then (a parking ticket, a bank error to sort out).

This is also where the other home features put the time things take on a day: vet visits (Pets), chores (Home
upkeep), grocery runs (Kitchen), haircuts (Looks) and late nights at work (Work life) all come through `add`, so there
is one calendar.

An entry takes a slot in the companion's agenda (dungeon/life/agenda.py) the way outings do, so the life simulation
tells it as an event, and the chat context sees it in their next day's plans. It never lands on, or cancels, a plan
with the user, a trip away or a family tradition: it moves to the nearest free time instead (`place`). What gives way to a
new plan with the user follows the Life admin slider (`stands`): on Off and Light everything moves for the user; on
True to life an appointment booked with someone else (`fixed`) holds its time, so an outing asked for then goes to
another day and the companion says so (dungeon/life/outings.py); on Dramatic anything due that very day holds too.
Chores and paperwork always move. The user overrides any of it by moving the entry to another day themselves. Someone who leaves things to the
last minute puts off a chore now and then, never past its deadline.

Only the companion is tracked: circle members and townsfolk have no calendar. Costs are counted in money.household when
an entry is done (`purchases`). The Realism tab's Life admin slider (on the home features' shared scale) sets how much there
is: off, light (only what comes due), true to life, or dramatic (more errands, and surprises).
