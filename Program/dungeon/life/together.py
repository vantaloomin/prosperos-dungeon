"""Together or apart (Hit List #59, v0.12 Where you are): where each companion is with the user, always known.

Every companion is in one state with the user: Apart (texting, the default), Together (out somewhere, at their place
or at the user's) or, later, On a call. Rules set it from the agenda and the chat; the model never decides it. Being
together is an outing (dungeon/life/outings.py): going out, dinner at theirs, and the visits this module adds, so it
takes its slot in their day, holds no replies, ends with Head home and is kept as a memory like any other outing.

Visits come from the chat. "Come over?", "I'm at your door" and "can I come to yours?" become a visit by the same
rules as outings: the companion says yes when they are free and nearby, and otherwise the reply says why not (at work
until five, asleep, out, too far away). A visit with no day named starts now and ends on its own at a time the rules
pick (their bedtime, or early when they work the next morning), or when either side heads home.

Companions come to the user too, as often as the Getting together slider says (life_settings.together_realism:
0 never on their own, 1 light, 2 true to life, 3 often): they suggest meeting up or invite the user over (a first
text, dungeon/life/openers.py), and a close companion in the user's city sometimes knocks unannounced, never in the
user's quiet hours (openers.held) and never on an easy life (below level 2). "Not now" sends them home again.
