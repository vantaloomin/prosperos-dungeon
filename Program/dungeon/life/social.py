"""The social side of the feed: the companion's circle posting, liking and commenting.

Beside the companion's posts about life events (dungeon/life/feed.py), the feed carries posts
that are not life events, all assembled from data the simulation already has and fixed phrasing,
with no model:

- `friend`: a circle member shares one of their happened agenda entries (their diary).
- `status`: a passing thought of the companion's, from the day's weather, how they feel, the
  weekday or an interest. It never claims something happened.
- `birthday`: a shout-out on a circle member's birthday. `holiday`: a public holiday greeting.
- `city`: the companion passes on city news (an opening, a closing, road works, an annual event).
- `question`: a small either-or the user can answer; the answer goes to chat as a reply to it.

While grief is raw or heavy (dungeon/life/loss.py) the companion posts only a quiet status, if any.

Posts are written when the feed or Today is read, for the last few days up to now, under
idempotency keys seeded by the timeline and slot, so reading twice never posts twice. Likes and
comments are not stored: they follow from the post, the circle and the clock, so a comment shows
up some time after its post, a renamed friend comments under the new name and a removed one
leaves the conversation. The companion likes and comments on friends' posts the same way.
