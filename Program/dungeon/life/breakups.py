"""Breaks and breakups (Hit List #64, v0.13 Life Together): when rough patches pile up, a relationship can come apart.

Only on a real life and with drama (the Breakups switch, life_settings.breakups: on there, off on an easy life). It
grows out of rough patches (dungeon/life/rough_patches.py), one warning at a time, each a roll in the consequence
engine with the odds under Hidden values ("Why it went this way" on Today) where the user can make it go another way:

- a rough patch of the user's making that drags on (or the third in a few weeks) can leave things strained
  (`user:strained`): "Things are strained" on the Character page and the chat strip;
- strained a few days with a patch still open, they start thinking about a break (`user:thinking`): "They're thinking
  about a break";
- thinking about it a few days more with a patch still open, they ask for one (`user:break`), in a first text;
- the break lasts two or three weeks; at its end they decide (`user:after_break`): try again or end it.

A friendship has no break: strained can turn into a falling out (`user:falling_out`). You can talk them round at
every step: making up (the rough patch mended) and a few calm days ease a warning; during a break, sorry or a kind
gesture counts for a lot, and asking to try again is answered at once (`user:talk_round`). Either side can end it: the
user from the chat with fixed phrases ("I'm breaking up with you", "can we take a break from us"), the companion after
a break.

Afterwards they are exes: nothing is deleted (the steps stay in the scrapbook), they keep their own life in town and
are free to date, the one who moved in moves out (dungeon/life/moving_in.py), and texting drops off by rules (only a
birthday, or reaching out). Getting back together is possible: now and then an ex reaches out (`user:reach_out`), or
the user asks (`user:back_together`). Back together, they start again as a couple (exclusive), or living together when
they still do: the steps further on, an engagement or a marriage are taken back (the scrapbook keeps them). A marriage
ends with the breakup: it reads as a divorce (a separation in older cities, `separated`), and the wedding is no longer
theirs to talk about as a marriage.

No model decides anything; the model only puts it in words.
