"""The judge of Narrative Only (dungeon/rules/narrative.py; docs/requirements.md "Narrative Only").

Under Narrative Only each of a turn's actions gets a verdict instead of a roll: No, No, but, Yes, but or Yes, with a
one-line reason. The judge is a model (the Referee's own, else the narrator's), asked once per turn about all of the
turn's actions together. It reads who the character is (their own description, their wounds and lasting injuries),
the player's words, the scene with the people in it and how they feel toward the character, and the actions with the
difficulty the Referee and code gave each. It is not the narrator: it decides, and the narrator writes what it
decided. With no model, or an answer that cannot be read, the difficulty decides each one in code (narrative.result).

approach does better than a bare wish), who they are dealing with (that person's feelings toward the character, \
wants, fears, mood, and the moment), and what the world allows. Good outcomes are not owed: a long shot fails most of \
the time, and a sure thing usually works. Answer each with one verdict:
- yes: it works.
- yes_but: it works, at a cost or with a complication.
- no_but: it fails, but something is gained or learned.
- no: it fails.
And one short reason in plain words, naming what decided it (for "no_but", also what is gained). Answer with JSON only: \
