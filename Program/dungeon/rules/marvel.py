"""MARVEL, the house ruleset (Mabry Curve's dice): d100 plus a stat die, less a difficulty shift, onto six bands.

Read from Mabry Curve's roll log (rng/roll.py itself was not in the archive):
- A natural 1 to 10 is a critical failure, whatever the bonus.
- Otherwise the natural roll plus the stat die, less the difficulty shift, picks the band: 30 or less is a failure
  (however low the shift takes it), 31 to 50 a failure with an upside, 51 to 70 a success at a cost, 71 to 89 a
  success, and 90 or more a critical success.
- The stat die grows with the stat (STAT_DICE). An actor with no stats rolls with no die.
