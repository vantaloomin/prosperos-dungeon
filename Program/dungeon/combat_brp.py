"""Fights under BRP (docs/requirements.md "Combat"; docs/story.md "Fights under BRP").

The fight runs as dungeon/combat.py does (one player line is one round, foes close in and attack, morale, the defeat
table by what the foes want), with BRP's numbers from the pack:
- **Foes** are the pack's sample characters and animals, read from a foe's name (a thug is a Thug, a wolf a Wolf, a
  raider a Viking), else by how tough the MARVEL spec is. Each has its hit points, armour, Dodge, first attack and
  damage modifier.
- **The player's attack** keeps the turn's own d100, against the skill of the weapon carried (a sword is Melee
  Weapon (Sword), bare hands Brawl). The foe dodges with its Dodge, and the attack and the dodge are read on the
  Attack and Defense Matrix: a dodge at the attack's level or better stops it, one a level short takes it down a
  level. Damage is the weapon's dice plus the damage modifier (half for a thrown weapon or a bow), less armour. A
  special impales (the dice twice) or does its weapon's special; a critical does the dice's most and ignores armour.
- **Foes attack** with their skill; the character dodges the first attack each round with their Dodge, every one
  when the line says they defend. Armour is the sheet's.
- **Wounds.** A blow of at least half the character's hit points is a **major wound**: a Luck roll (POW x5), and on a
  failure the Major Wound Table takes characteristic points for good (as the Injury persistence setting allows).
  At 2 hit points or fewer after one, the character collapses; at 0 or less the wound is fatal, and the defeat table
  decides (BRP has no death saves: someone may yet drag them clear).
- **Morale:** once a foe is down or under half its hit points, the others roll Luck; a failure breaks them.
- **Magic** (dungeon/rules/brp.py cast; the roll spent the power points). Blast, Fire and Frost do 1D6 a level
  that armour absorbs, Lightning and Wounding 1D6 a level straight to hit points; the target may dodge any but
  Wounding (a touch). A special rolls the dice twice and keeps the better, a critical does the most and ignores
  armour. Protection adds a point of armour a level for the rest of the fight, Sharpen 5% and a point of damage a
  level to the character's blows, Dull takes as much off the foes'. Control pits the character's POW against the
  foe's on the resistance table (50% + 5% a point of difference): won, the foe stands idle. Heal heals 1D6 a level
  (its most on a critical). The rest are the narrator's to tell.
- **Healing** is slow, as written: each hit point back takes 7 days divided by a 1D3 roll (3, 4 or 7 nights of
  rest). First Aid on the character's own wound restores 1D3 at once, once a wound (dungeon/sheet.py).
