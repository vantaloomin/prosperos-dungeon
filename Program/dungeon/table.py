"""The Table: this campaign's rules (docs/story.md "The Table").

Settings follow the user from world to world (dungeon/restore.py KEPT_SETTINGS), so rules kept there leaked: turn the
dice on in one campaign and they were on in every other. The Table keeps them with the campaign (story_campaign), so
each world's campaign plays by its own.

- **Tone** (intensity, drama, injury_persistence, defeat, levels, veils, voice) is the world's at the start of every
  campaign: 'world' for the dials and the voice, no categories moved off the preset, the world's veils, permanent
  injuries, a 5E defeat as written (death saves), shopkeepers with finite cash, carrying limited by slots, and the
  world's own clock (story time, or real time for a world that lives that way). Picking a preset clears the categories moved off it.
- **Narration format** (pov, tense, length) is the player's at any time. A new campaign starts in close third person,
  past tense (requirements "Narrator prompting": the default for a persona); a story with no campaign start, or a
  campaign from before the format could be chosen, keeps second person and present tense, as Story mode always had.
- **Display taste** (show_odds, roll_dice, show_adult_side, gm_view, cutaways) starts where the player last left it,
  which the workspace settings remember.

Either route sets a rule for the campaign being played: PUT /story/table, or PUT /settings (scripts and older callers).
Both also remember the choice in the workspace settings, which a new campaign's taste starts from. story.clear wipes
story_campaign, so a new story begins with a fresh table. Not in timeline.SAVED: a rule changed and then a line rewound
stays changed.
