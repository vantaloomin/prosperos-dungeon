"""Journeys on the travel map (requirements "Time and travel"; docs/story.md "Journeys").

Each world has a travel map (world/data/travel/<world>.json): places joined by roads, each road with its hours on
foot, its terrain and its danger, and each region with its road encounters. A place is a whole town (its city and
the place one arrives at) or a place on the Road (world/data/cities/vallarith-road.json) for one not yet built out.

- **Fog of war.** The character knows the places they have been, the places next to those, and the famous ones
  everybody has heard of (a capital). The rest stay hidden until found.
- **A journey is decided before the narrator writes it.** "I set out for Eriane" plans the way by the shortest
  roads and rolls each road against its danger. A road that turns up an encounter draws one from the region's
  table: a sight or a meeting the narrator weaves in, or a danger to get past (a Luck roll, like a dangerous place
  in town); one that brings foes starts a fight where it happens, and the journey stops there.
- **Every road costs time and food.** Walking takes the road's hours, nights on the road pass in camp, and each day
  eats one food from the pack (bread, dried meat, cheese); without it the character goes hungry. A modern world's map
  says how people get about instead (`by`: "car or bus", Havenbrooke's), and with no `food` a trip eats nothing.

The places known are game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED); each line's journey is kept
with it, so telling the turn again changes nothing.
