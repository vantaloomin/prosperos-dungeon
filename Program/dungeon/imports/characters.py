"""Bring your characters: a character file from another app becomes a companion living in this world.

The file (dungeon/imports/formats.py) gives who they are: name, description, personality and how they write.
The world gives the rest, the way it does for a world's first companion (dungeon/worlds.py `starter`): a
grown-up townsperson's sheet, picked by the character's name, lends a job, a neighborhood, a routine and the
city's timezone (dungeon/cast.py `profile`), so they have a life from the first day. The town keeps that
townsperson; the sheet is only a template. No model is asked and there is no review step: the user changes
anything afterwards on the Character page ("The world exists outside of User").

The character's own lorebook becomes theirs, a lorebook file on its own becomes the world's
(dungeon/lore.py), and a card's picture is kept with their reference pictures, marked "Not stated" until
the user says where it came from (as the Study import does, dungeon/imports/study.py). A scenario, greetings
and creator's notes set up someone else's story, so they are not used: the companion's life starts here.
