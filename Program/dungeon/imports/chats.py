"""Bring your old chats (Hit List #37): a SillyTavern chat or a role/content transcript as older history.

Reading the two formats is adapted from prosperos-study server/migration/transcript_conversion.py
(`sillytavern`, `role_messages`). Changes: nothing is reviewed or mapped by hand; the user's lines become
the user's, the character's the companion's; system, narrator and hidden lines are left out, and so, in a
SillyTavern group chat, are the other characters' lines (the companion is the one whose name they have, else the one
who speaks most); the selected
swipe is taken and its date read (`send_date` in SillyTavern's several formats, ISO text or epoch numbers).

The world exists outside of the user, so an import asks nothing: the messages land before everything
already in the chat (lower `seq`), dated from the file or, without dates, in made-up sittings ending an
hour before the first message there. Each carries `import_id`, so it reads as history but never counts as
new conversation: no reply, unread count, notification, mood, opener, recap, usual hours, closeness or
consequence comes from it (each of those reads `import_id IS NULL`, and `records.from_old_chats` keeps what
only an old chat said out of plans to follow up and shared moments). The user's lines go through the usual
rule-based memory pass (memory/formation.py) at once, in bounded batches and without a model call, so recall
finds what was said back then; a fact stated there never ends or corrects one said later.
