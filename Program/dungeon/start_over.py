"""Starting over with the same companion, or deleting the companion altogether.

Both take a verified backup first (with reference pictures), so either can be undone by restoring
it from Settings > Backups; the backup's name says which it came before. The user confirms by
typing the companion's name.

Every table in the schema is in exactly one group below (tests/test_start_over.py checks this):

- WORKSPACE stays through both: settings, model connections, image backends, lookup services,
  cities and the user's changes to them, notification and phone setup, the user's own story (Story mode,
  apart from every companion).
  Deletion markers stay too, so a restore still honours them.
- CHARACTER is who the companion is: the companion, every version of the character, and their
  look (reference pictures, adapters, training and test pictures). Starting over keeps it;
  deleting removes it.
- HISTORY is everything that happened: every timeline with its chats, memories, life, feed,
  circle, home, closeness, the people the user mentioned and the real-world lookups made for them. Both remove it.

With one companion in the workspace, a group is cleared whole. When the user has switched main
characters (dungeon/cast.py), only the main character's rows go: those on their timelines, or naming
them, or hanging off those (OWN says how each table finds its rows). Lookups stay then, being about the
city the companions share. Deleting the main character then brings back whoever stepped back most recently.
Starting over gives the companion a fresh active timeline that begins now, as a newly created companion has.
