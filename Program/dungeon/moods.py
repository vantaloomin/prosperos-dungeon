"""Moods (Feature Hit List #14, wave E, widened to every companion): how each companion feels right now, in group
chats and in their own chat with the user, who they're not speaking to, and walking out (docs/group-chat.md, "Moods").

Every companion has at most one current mood (`moods`): a feeling (calm, happy, excited, annoyed, hurt, angry,
anxious, sad), an intensity from 1 to 3 and, for some, who it is about. All by rules, never a model:

- Events lead. Finding out a secret that was kept from them (dungeon/secrets.py) hurts, toward whoever it is
  about: hurt 2, or furious (angry 3) for someone with a temper. A storyline beat of their own that turned out badly
  today leaves them sad, and a good one happy, when nothing else is going on.
- A reply nudges it: a sentence of their own that names a feeling and another member ("honestly I'm so annoyed
  with Sally") moves that feeling toward that person one step, never past 2 (angry replies alone never reach
  furious, so two members can't talk each other into walking out). Negations, quotes, "lol" and "jk" don't count,
  and it is at most one step a reply.
- Their own day sets it when nothing else has (`day_moods`): a bad storyline beat, a mood mark from the consequence
  engine, their day going off plan. Everyday moods stay mild.
- The user's words move it a step (`from_user`): care lifts a low mood, words that sting leave them a little hurt
  (angry only with a temper). Their own chat gets it as a per-reply note (`chat_lines`) that colors their tone.
- It fades a step every `FADE` and resets overnight, their time.
- Only someone with a temper gets angry: a temper the user wrote into their character ("hot-tempered", "quick to
  anger"), or the temper flaw a townsperson came with. Anyone else tops out at annoyed or hurt.

What it does, the ladder:
- annoyed: their replies stay short;
- hurt or angry at 2 or more toward someone here: they ignore them. They are never picked to answer them, their
  prompt says "You're not speaking to Sally right now", and a reply that still names Sally is written once more;
- furious toward someone here for `WALK_OUT_REPLIES` replies, or two people furious at each other (the one with
  the stronger temper goes first): they walk out ("Billy left the group."), only when the group's "People can walk
  out" switch is on (off by default). They can be added back once they're no longer angry; until then Add says why.

Moods are a hidden value: the people panel and Today show them only with the workspace's `show_moods` on.
