"""A character reference sheet, made on Codex before any other picture of a companion (Vanta, 2026-10-11).

When a picture of the companion is about to go to a Codex backend and they have no sheet yet, the app
first asks Codex for a three-panel reference sheet (a face close-up, a front body view without the head,
a back view, on a grey studio background), saves it as the companion's identity reference, and then
makes the real picture with the sheet attached. Every later picture of them on Codex follows the same
sheet, so the first picture of someone costs two Codex calls and every later one a single call.

The sheet is a fixed template filled from the companion's own data, never written by a model: their
looks sheet and appearance in words, an everyday outfit (the profile picture's), and the backend's
picture style. When they already have a profile picture, it is attached and the sheet follows it.
Editing their appearance makes a new sheet the next time; the old one stays on disk until it is
replaced. The sheet is classified and must be eligible for the backend like any request (F6); when
it is not, or the sheet fails for any reason but a sign-in problem, the picture is made from the
description alone, as before.

Codex calls stay serial: the sheet and the picture run one after the other inside the one Codex slot
the picture already holds, and the adapter's own lock still covers each call.

**REFERENCE:** {source}

**CHARACTER DESCRIPTION:** {description}

**OBJECTIVE:** Create a professional, production-ready, three-panel character reference sheet designed specifically \
for AI image generation, character consistency, and cinematic production.

### 1. IDENTITY & REFERENCE LOCK

Preserve the exact identity and appearance of the reference character. Maintain the original facial features, skin \
tone, age, hairstyle, hair color, body proportions, clothing, accessories, and distinctive characteristics. Do not \
redesign, beautify, reinterpret, or replace the character. The character is fictional; preserve its original design.

### 2. BACKGROUND & LAYOUT

Use a solid, neutral, medium-gray studio background across all three panels. Create a clean horizontal triptych \
with three equally organized vertical panels, subtle separators, consistent neutral studio lighting, realistic \
shadows, and professional production-sheet presentation. Render the character as: {style}.

### PANEL 01 — FACE DETAIL / CLOSE-UP

Create a tight, high-resolution close-up of the exact character's face and head. Clearly reveal the facial \
structure, eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, skin texture, hairline, hairstyle, and other identifying details. Use a \
neutral expression, natural lighting, sharp focus, and realistic anatomical detail. Frame the face large enough to \
serve as a precise identity reference.

### PANEL 02 — FRONT BODY VIEW / FACE EXCLUDED

Show the exact same character standing upright in a straight, neutral, front-facing full-body pose. Frame the image \
from the base of the neck down to the feet, with the entire face and head excluded from the frame. Clearly show the \
shoulders, torso, arms, hands, clothing, waist, legs, footwear, body proportions, and complete silhouette. Keep the \
arms slightly separated from the torso so the body structure and outfit remain clearly visible.

### PANEL 03 — BACK BODY VIEW

Show the exact same character standing upright in a straight, neutral, rear-facing full-body pose. Display the back \
of the head, hairstyle from behind, shoulders, back, arms, clothing details, legs, and footwear. Keep the complete \
character visible from head to feet. Match the exact outfit, body proportions, hairstyle, and physical appearance \
established in the other panels.

### 3. STRICT CONSISTENCY RULES

- All three panels must depict the same individual or character.
- Preserve identical clothing, colors, accessories, hairstyle, body proportions, and physical characteristics.
- Use consistent camera height, neutral studio lighting, gray background, and realistic proportions.
- Keep the front and back views anatomically correct and naturally posed.
- Do not invent additional characters, outfits, accessories, or design variations.
- Do not add action poses, cinematic environments, dramatic lighting, decorative graphics, text, labels, or \
unnecessary details.
- Do not allow the character to become cropped in the back-view panel.
- The center panel must exclude the face and head completely.
- The left panel must prioritize facial identity and fine details.
- The right panel must prioritize the rear silhouette and back-of-head details.

### 4. FINAL OUTPUT

Generate one clean, landscape-format, three-panel professional character reference sheet. Prioritize reference \
accuracy, clear separation of views, realistic detail, and practical usability as a character reference. The final \
image must function as a technical character reference rather than a decorative character collage.

**RESOLUTION:** Generate the final image in landscape format at the largest size available, {width} × {height} \
pixels.

**FINAL PRIORITY:** Exact reference preservation, accurate front and back views, clear facial identity, consistent \
wardrobe, neutral gray background, and production-ready character continuity."""
