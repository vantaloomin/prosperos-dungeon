"""Pictures in chat: asked what they are up to, or for a selfie or a meme, the companion can send one.

The app decides when, not the model: fixed phrasings ask for a picture
(X3). A photo, selfie or view shows the companion's current routine slot composed exactly as the
simulation will compose it (the same agenda entry, plan and seed), so the reply, the picture and the
event that slot becomes all tell one account. It is made on a feed post keyed to that future event
(`feed.PHOTO_KEY`); when the simulation writes the event it joins that post, so the feed shows the
same picture and the event exists once. Until then the post has no event and stays out of the feed.
A meme is a joke, not an event: its captions come from templates (`memes.py`) and its picture is
made on a post of its own that never reaches the feed.

The companion also sends pictures nobody asked for, like a person would: now and then with a reply
(a seeded chance, a meme more likely when the user sounds bored or down), and, when they may text
first, a photo text of something they are out doing (`share`). Both go through the same rules and
are capped, and the first-message rules (`openers.held`) decide when a photo text may go out.

Every picture goes through the same classification and routing as any other image (F6): NSFW only
to a backend that accepts it, the prohibited tier nowhere, and anything uncertain counts as NSFW. A request
with nowhere to go sends nothing, and nothing here ever holds up the reply.
