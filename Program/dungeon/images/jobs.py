"""Image jobs (PRD F3, F4, F6).

A job freezes its inputs, its classification and the reason it was routed where it was. The
post records which job is current. A result only lands on the post while its job is still
current, so a late result never overwrites a newer selection; it stays a version the user can
pick. A refused request is recorded as a failed job, so the post shows why.
