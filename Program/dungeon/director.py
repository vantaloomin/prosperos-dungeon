"""The director, v0: a game master's guiding hand (requirements "The director"; docs/story.md "The director").

Code that holds the campaign's plot state and decides what the world pushes toward. It never decides what the player
does and never changes roll odds.

- **Arcs and the spine.** Each world's arcs for its era (world/data/arcs/<world>.json) are seeded as the campaign
  starts, each at its first stage, with a thread for it. The arc the player bites on hardest (play touching its
  threads) becomes the spine once it has COMMIT bites, in the first three chapters (CHAPTER_LINES lines each); if
  none has by then, the world's default spine. An arc the player later turns to far harder can take its place.
  Arcs not chosen go on in the background.
- **Threads are the GM's notebook** (story_threads): each arc, each quest (jobs, oaths and the town's own) and each
  nemesis opens one, with the arc it feeds, a heat (how recently and strongly play touched it; it cools every line)
  and a bite count, the hidden truth and the words that tell code play touched it. The journal shows the ones the
  character has come across, as they understand them.
- **The hand** (picked at campaign start): Soft, Guiding (the default) or Firm. Arcs move a stage on their own
  clocks (PACE in 100 a story day, twice that for the spine); under Soft that only changes the world's truth, under
  Guiding the arc's people come looking for the character, under Firm it shows in the scene wherever they are.
- **The hidden GM note**, every turn: the pressure the scene is under (from the tension curve), a seed to plant if
  it fits, the threads the people present carry, the antagonist near, and what of the arcs is due. A stage above
  the character's tier only ever reaches them as a clue or a rumor, never its fight.
- **The tension curve.** Each line is a quiet, social, pressure or crisis scene (from its rolls and fight). After
  SLACK quiet lines in a row (fewer the more eventful the drama setting), the note asks for pressure from the
  hottest thread or the arc due; after a crisis it lets the next scene breathe.
- **Side quests leave a mark.** A job offered may link straight into an active arc (LINK in 100), with one of its
  seeds as a tie.
- **Nemeses.** A foe who got away from the character, or beat them, may be promoted (NEMESIS in 100): a grudge, what
  they remember of how the character fights, and a thread. After NEMESIS_DAYS they come back with a plan, through
  the note. One the character kills on the page stays dead.

Seeds and payoffs, adopted details and the arcs' planned beats are dungeon/plotting.py.

All of it is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
