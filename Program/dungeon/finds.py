"""Decide before describing (requirements "Decide before describing"; docs/story.md "What is inside").

When the player looks into something the story hasn't settled (a chest, a drawer, a crate, a body, a stranger's
purse, a room), code rolls what is there from the town's tables (world/data/finds/<city>.json) and stores it before
the narrator writes a word: in story_finds, and in the record as a fact. The narrator is told what is there and
describes only that. The same thing looked into again holds the same contents, so a trap or a coin was there
before anyone looked.

- A failed search roll (Mind) misses what is there: the contents stay as rolled, unseen, for a better look later.
- Taking what was found ("I take the coins", "I pocket the knife") moves it into the pack and purse, within carry
  slots; what does not fit stays. What is taken from someone's things is stolen (story_inventory.stolen): a purse or
  a pocket always, anything else at a place someone owns. Only a body, or a place out in the open (UNOWNED), gives
  what it holds freely. Honest shops won't buy stolen goods; a fence will (dungeon/inventory.py).

- A fight won leaves the fallen where they fell (spoils): their bodies hold what they carried, decided as they fall
  and unseen until searched: a person's coins (more on a robber), and their weapon when the town sells its like; a
  beast, the dead or a fiend, nothing. Every town knows a body, with or without a finds table.

All of it is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
