"""What the narrator is reminded of, and what the characters still remember (requirements "Memory and context";
docs/story.md "Layered recall and forgetting").

- **Layered recall.** Each turn the narrator reads the recent turns word for word (dungeon/story.py), the story so
  far as a summary (dungeon/record.py), and facts from the record chosen by relevance: every death and promise,
  then the facts about who is present, where the scene is and anything just mentioned (names, places, items), then
  the newest of the rest.
- **Forgetting, but grudges stick.** The record keeps every fact. What the character is treated as remembering
  fades by its weight and its age in turns: small things soon, notable ones later, big ones (a death, a promise or
  debt, a betrayal) never. A fact about someone the character feels strongly about (any feeling at SHARP or more,
  dungeon/feelings.py) stays sharp whatever its age, and mentioning a fact again refreshes it. Hidden truth never
  fades, since the character never knew it.
- **A roll can recall a faded detail.** "I try to remember the ferryman" adds a Mind roll to the turn when a faded
  fact matches; a success brings what the character knew back to mind.
- **Context fits the model, with a player cap.** The workspace setting `context_cap` caps the tokens a turn may
  send; the record's facts give way before the recent turns do, and the summary goes first.
