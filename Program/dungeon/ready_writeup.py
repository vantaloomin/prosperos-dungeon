"""A companion made while "Set it up for me" downloads (Iris, v09-appearance-first-launch.md): the user saves what
they filled in, and once the model is ready it writes the rest, as the quick start would have.

Only fields still empty are filled, so anything the user wrote, before or during the download, stays theirs; the
result is a new version of the character, so it can be undone from the version list like any other edit.
