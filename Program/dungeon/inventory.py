"""What the character carries and what the town sells, v0 (requirements "Inventory and equipment", "Shops and
economy"; docs/story.md "Gear and the shop").

Code owns every item and every coin: the narrator is told what the character carries, what is in their purse and,
in a shop, its stock and prices, and it never adds, removes or prices anything. A town's item file
(world/data/items/<city>.json) lists its items with base prices in the city's currency, its shops with their
starting stock, and the kit each premade starts with.

- Money is kept in hundredths of the currency, so sums never drift.
- Carrying is counted in slots: a knife takes a quarter, a sword one. The character carries 5 plus half their
  Vitality, unless the Table's `carry_limit` is 'off'.
- A shop is open while one of its staff is at work (the townsfolk rules). Its stock is finite: what the player
  buys is gone. It buys what it deals in at its sell rate (half the base price).
- Buying and selling happen on the shop window or in the story ("I buy two loaves"); each trade is logged and
  adds a line to the story.
- Shops restock on the story clock: every `restock_days` (RESTOCK_DAYS by default) what was sold comes back up to the
  file's stock, and what the player sold them stays to be sold again.
- Shopkeepers have finite cash (the Table's `shop_cash`, 'finite' by default): a shop's `cash` (else half its starting
  stock's worth) grows with what it sells and shrinks with what it buys, and is topped up as it restocks. A village
  shop can't buy a dragon hoard; 'unlimited' turns this off.
- Stolen goods are tracked (story_inventory.stolen: what was taken from someone's things, dungeon/finds.py). An honest
  shop won't buy them, nor anything illegal; a fence (a shop with `fence`) buys both, at its own low rate.
- Services are sold the same way (category 'service': lodging by comfort tier, meals, drink, baths, stabling, a guide),
  from finite stock that comes back each day (an inn's `restock_days` of 1: so many rooms a night). A service is not
  carried: it is kept as paid for that story day (story_services) and the narrator is told, so it quotes the tier's
  real price and plays the room the character paid for.
- Gear wears (story_inventory.condition): sound, damaged, broken. An attack that fails critically damages the weapon
  swung (dungeon/combat.py): a damaged weapon hits a step softer, a broken one is no weapon at all. Damaged goods sell
  for half, broken ones for a fifth (CONDITION_VALUE). A smith's repair (a service of kind 'repair') mends the worst
  thing carried one step, broken to damaged, damaged to sound.
- Life Cards move markets (dungeon/happenings.py): a shortage or a glut changes a kind of goods' prices in a town for
  some days (story_markets), both what the shops charge and what they pay.
- Haggling is a roll: an Allure action aimed at a better price, in an open shop, moves the shop's prices for the
  rest of the story day by how it landed (a critical a quarter off, a success 15%, a success at a cost 10% and the
  keeper remembers, a critical failure 20% on). One haggle a shop a day.

All of it is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
