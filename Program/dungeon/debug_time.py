"""Debug time (Settings > Debug): check several days of a companion's life in minutes.

Everything that reads the time reads the app clock (clock.AppClock on Database.clock): life batches,
the agenda, first messages, paced replies, the feed, notifications, townsfolk and chat context. Debug
time moves that clock ahead and can run it faster, so all of them follow without special cases.

Starting takes a verified backup (Settings > Backups, "Before debug time") and a plain copy of the
database. Jumping ahead walks through the skipped time in steps, as if the app had stayed open, then
looks in once the way opening the app does. Nothing extra calls a model: what runs is what would have
run in that time. Returning to real time restores the copy, so real-time history stays as it was; the
user can keep what happened instead, but the companion's life then waits until real time catches up.
