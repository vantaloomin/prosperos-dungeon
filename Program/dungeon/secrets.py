"""Secrets: who knows what, and who must not find out (docs/group-chat.md, "Secrets").

A small ledger (`knowledge`, `knowledge_holders`) records facts a companion could not have learned in their own
life, and who knows each one. A speaker's prompt gets a secret only when they are on its knowers list, so Sally's
prompt never holds Billy and Katie's secret in the first place: no model is trusted to keep one it was handed.

Where secrets come from, all by rules:
- The user declares one in the Secrets panel: what it is, who it's about, who knows and who must not find out.
- A storyline that is a secret registers itself once its first beat has happened (`STORY_SECRETS`): the companion
  who found out and the people in it know, and it is kept from everyone else.
- A line in a companion's own description that reads as a secret ("secretly", "nobody knows", "never told")
  registers as one only they know, kept from everyone else.

Rows point at their source rather than copying it: a storyline's text is filled with today's names, a character
line is re-read from the current sheet (edit the sheet and the secret follows; remove the line and it ends),
and a declared secret is the user's own words, edited in the panel. So a correction reaches the ledger.

How people come to know one (`via` on each holder row):
- origin: the people it started with.
- witness: said in a group while they were there (the group's `present` list), by anyone.
- slip: a knower said it in front of someone it was kept from, and slips were allowed.
- history: added to a group with everything so far, where it had been said.
- reveal: the user chose "Let them find out", or told them in a group while it was kept from them.

A knower's reply in a group where someone it's kept from is present is checked by rules (`hits`): it names every
person the secret is about (the speaker counts as named when it's about them) and enough of its key words. A hit
is redrafted once with a reminder; if the redraft still gives it away, it stays as a slip only at the "soap
opera" drama setting, and otherwise that reply is held back. Paraphrases get through; that is accepted because a
slip is shown and recorded, never silently undone.

A gossip passes a secret on only to someone they feel Close to (`spreads`, with memory/pairs.py).
