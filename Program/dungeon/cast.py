"""Switching the main character to someone the companion has met around town (dungeon/world/townsfolk.py).

The app is always about one companion, the one in slot 1 (dungeon/characters.py). The user can make a
townsperson the companion has met the main character instead: the townsperson gets a full character
definition, drafted from their rule sheet (or fleshed out by the text model), and from then on the model
plays them. The companion who steps back keeps every chat, memory and timeline, and goes on living in
the same city by the townsfolk's rules (dungeon/life/encounters.py), where the new main character can
run into them. They keep their chat (dungeon/chats.py), so switching is like opening
another chat: it puts them in slot 1 again, history intact.
