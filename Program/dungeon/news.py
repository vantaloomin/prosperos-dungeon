"""News travels (Feature Hit List #9): word of what happens in a companion's life gets around, one hop a day.

News is something big enough to share that happened in a companion's own life: a storyline beat that turned out
good or bad (never one of the storylines that are secrets) or a new chapter of their life. It starts with them and
spreads at the end of each day, for `SPREAD_DAYS` days, along who knows whom (memory/pairs.py): from a companion to
the people in their circle and the other companions they know, and from a circle person back to the companion and
to the rest of that circle. Whether one person passes it to another is the consequence engine's call (choice
`news:pass_on`, dungeon/consequences.py): likelier the closer the teller feels, from someone whose own news it is,
or from a gossip. The dice are seeded by the news, the pair and the day, so a day never changes after the fact.
So the sister hears Tuesday night, a coworker Wednesday, and a friend who is a companion too may text the user
about it Thursday, before the companion has said a word.

Everyone remembers who told them (`news_holders.told_by`). Saying it in a group counts too: everyone there hears
it (via `group`), from whoever said it. Openers (life/openers.py) and group replies (groups.py) pick from what each
person has heard. Secrets keep their own rules (dungeon/secrets.py) and never travel this way.

Only life events travel, never anything from the user's chats, so no companion can seem to have read the user's
chats with someone else; prompts also say they don't know whether the user has heard.
