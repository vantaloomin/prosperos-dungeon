"""Chapters, bookmarks, Ironman and the player's notebook (requirements "Memory and context" round 2 and "Campaign
management"; docs/story.md "Chapters and the branch tree").

- **Chapters close at scene breaks.** A change of place, a journey or a rest, the end of a fight or of a quest, or
  the player closing one themselves (with a name, if they like) leaves a break pending; the player's next line opens
  the next chapter. The chapter that ends is summarized as the break is made by the Continuity model, when one is
  chosen, which also names it unless the player did and says what it leaves open; the next chapter opens with a
  short "previously" from that.
- **Chapters follow the branches.** A chapter starts at one of the player's lines and its end is recorded on the
  branch where it ended, so both are seen through dungeon/timeline.py `visible` like the messages: a branch shares
  its parent's chapters up to where it forked, and an end on another branch is not this branch's.
- **The tree** maps every branch and its own chapters; a branch left with the character dead or lost is marked by how
  it ended.
- **Bookmarks** name moments to find them fast; going to one plays on in its branch.
- **Ironman**, chosen at campaign start, turns off going back: no going back to a line, no other branches, no
  telling a line again with new dice, so death is final.
- **The notebook** is the player's own, spans every branch, and no model ever reads it.
