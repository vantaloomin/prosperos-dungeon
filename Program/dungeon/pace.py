"""How fast a story turn goes (requirements "Turn speed"; docs/story.md "Turn speed").

A turn can chain the Referee, the narrator, the prose rewrite, a contradiction rewrite, fact extraction and the
summary, so each turn has a time budget and every step is timed and logged with the player's line
(story_turn_steps):
- Obvious actions (walking, looking, plain talk) skip the Referee's model; the keyword rules settle them.
- The narration streams as it is written (dungeon/story_routes.py), and fact extraction and the summary run after
  the reply is on screen. They finish before the next turn starts.
- The contradiction check runs only when the narration names someone the ledger says is dead; a clean turn costs
  no extra call.
- Over budget, the optional steps give way: the prose rewrite first, then the contradiction rewrite (logged as
  skipped). Dice and the ledger are never skipped. The em dash fix always runs; it costs nothing.
