"""Guests in group chats: people from the members' own lives who join for a while (docs/group-chat.md, "Guests").

A guest is someone a companion in the group knows: a person in their circle (a sister, a coworker, an old friend),
or a townsperson they keep running into. Guests are group members like any other (a stay in `group_members`, under
their own person key: `circle:<timeline>:<n>` or a townsfolk key), with `host`, the companion who knows them.

Rules decide everything, no model calls:

- **Who comes in.** When someone in the chat names a person a member knows ("Ada would love this"), that member
  may pull them in: seeded by the message, more often at higher Settings > Realism > "Guests drop in"
  (`guests_realism`), never while that person is asleep, at most `MOST_GUESTS` passing guests at once and one
  pull-in per group in `PULL_GAP`. The user can also add or remove anyone a member knows.
- **How much they say.** Guests answer like members (anyone named first, then by weight, a little less often than
  members) but at most `GUEST_REPLIES` times a conversation, and never while asleep by their own day.
- **How long they stay.** Once the chat has been quiet for `QUIET` a passing guest slips out. Someone who comes back
  `REGULAR_VISITS` times becomes a regular and stays; the user can keep anyone with one tap (`kept`).

A guest has no 1:1 chat and no memory of their own: they remember the group through its own history, and their
reply is built from a short rule-made sheet (who they are to the host, how they come across and see themselves,
what they're doing right now).
