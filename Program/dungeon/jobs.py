"""Jobs from factions' needs (requirements "Quests and factions"; docs/story.md "Jobs and oaths").

Each faction in play lists the jobs it needs done in the towns it holds (world/data/factions/<world>.json `jobs`).
On a day in town, while a faction holding the town has no job open, it may offer one (OFFER in 100): a quest of the
job's own, known to the character, with its deadline on the story clock, its pay in the town's day wages and the
standing it earns. Whether it is done is the Continuity model's call, as for any quest (dungeon/quests.py); a job
that lapses costs nothing but what happens, one failed costs standing. Each job carries the loose ends it leaves
(`ties`) for the story director.
