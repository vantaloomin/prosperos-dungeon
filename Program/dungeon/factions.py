"""Factions, their clocks and the character's standing (requirements "Quests and factions"; docs/story.md
"Factions").

Each world's factions in play (world/data/factions/<world>.json) are the powers with a hand on its travel map: a
realm, a guild, the elves past the border stones. Each has goals, holds some places, has rivals and allies, and runs
progress clocks.

- **Clocks move on the world clock.** Each story day, each open clock may move a segment (the file's `pace`, in
  100). When one fills, what it meant happens: the record keeps it as the world's truth, and the news reaches the
  character on their next day in a town, whether or not they had a hand in it.
- **Standing is a Reputation track**, -5 to 5, shown in words ("trusted", "distrusted") or, with the dice shown,
  the number. Life Cards move it now; jobs for factions will too.
- **The narrator is told the powers that hold the place**: who they are, what they want, how far their clocks have
  run and how they stand with the character. It acts through their people and never announces a clock.

Clocks and standing are game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
