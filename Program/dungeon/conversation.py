"""Saved conversation with idempotent sends, visible incomplete replies and alternatives (PRD C2, C4, M9).

A reply only becomes the active response when it completed against the memory revision and
character version it was built from. Otherwise it is kept as `withheld` so a correction made
while it was generating can never be contradicted by the stale reply.

A reply can be awaited in the sending request, or the request can return as soon as the attempt
is saved and the client follows its text with `events()`. Generation belongs to the app, not to
the request or the stream: closing a stream never stops a reply, only Stop does.
