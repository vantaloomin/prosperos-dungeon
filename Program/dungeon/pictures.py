"""Pictures the user sends in chat.

The interface shrinks a picture and re-encodes it before upload, which also drops its location and
camera data, and the server keeps the file as it arrives. A picture is the user's own: unlike the
pictures the app generates (dungeon/images/content.py), it is not classified, and it goes to the
model the user chose for Seeing pictures.

That model describes each picture once, before the reply. The description joins the message's text
wherever the conversation is read (the reply's context, recall, search vectors), so the companion
remembers what they were shown without the picture being sent again. A model that cannot see, or a
service that refuses the picture, leaves it unseen: the companion then says in character that it
would not load, as with a link, and the interface shows the real reason under the picture.
