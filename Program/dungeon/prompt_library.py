"""The core prompts a power user may reword in Settings > Advanced (docs/prompts.md).

Each prompt's default lives where it is used: a module constant written for `str.format`, or one of
the character drafting files in `dungeon/prompts/`. Here they are shown and stored in one form,
with `{{placeholder}}` marks the app fills in. A user's wording is stored in `prompt_overrides`
with the default it replaced, so an update that changes the default can say so without touching
their text. Wording is checked before it is saved: every placeholder the default uses must stay,
and no unknown one may be added, so a typo cannot break replies.

Only the wording is editable. The in-character filter, OOC handling, the NSFW check and every
reply's validation are code (dungeon/in_character.py and the callers) and run whatever it says.
