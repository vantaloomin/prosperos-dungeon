"""Replace the active workspace with a backup (PRD persistence section and M5).

The current workspace is never overwritten: its database, images and adapters move to
`replaced-<time>/` beside it first, and move back if the restore fails. A backup can be older
than deletions made since, so the deletion records the current workspace keeps are applied to
the restored one: deleted memories stay deleted and redacted messages stay redacted. Settings are not rolled
back either (Vanta, 2026-10-08): the current workspace's settings, model connections, image backends, lookups and
paired phones carry over, so nothing is switched off or paused. Restoring with no current workspace (a new
computer) still holds the restored one for review, since its connections belonged to another machine
(backup.hold_for_review).
