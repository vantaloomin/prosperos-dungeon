"""Replace the active workspace with a backup (PRD persistence section).

The current workspace is never overwritten: its database moves to `replaced-<time>/` beside it first, and moves
back if the restore fails. Settings are not rolled back (from Companion, Vanta, 2026-10-08): the current workspace's
settings, model connections and image backends carry over. Restoring with no current workspace (a new computer)
drops the restored one's saved credentials, since its connections belonged to another machine
(backup.hold_for_review).
