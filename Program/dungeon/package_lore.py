"""A world package's lore in play (docs/packages.md): the package's public lorebook, as a lore book of the campaign's
world (dungeon/lore.py), so the narrator reads its entries by keyword like any imported lorebook.

Only the `lore` section comes in: it is public text by design, and the package's hidden truths stay with the director
and the record. Entries for another era than the campaign's are left out (an entry with no `eras` holds in all of
them). The book is read from the package file, so an edited or imported world plays as edited; when the package's
lore changes, the book is replaced on the next campaign start.
