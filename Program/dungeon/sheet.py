"""Character sheets: MARVEL stats per actor (dungeon/rules/marvel.py). The player's character is 'persona'; an actor
with no stats rolls with no die.

The campaign's ruleset is chosen at its start and then locked (story_campaign.ruleset; docs/requirements.md

own sheet (story_sheet, branched with the story), and `check` rolls the persona's checks its way: the Referee's
approach (a MARVEL stat) and the action's words decide what the ruleset tests. Everyone else keeps MARVEL stats.
