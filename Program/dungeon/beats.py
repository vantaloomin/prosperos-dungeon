"""Off-page beats and word getting around (requirements "Off-page beats", "NPC minds: word gets around";
docs/story.md "Off-page beats").

The people the character is connected to keep living while the character is elsewhere. A beat is a Life Card from
the world's beat scene (dungeon/life/cards.py) happening to one of them, {them}:
- **Who.** People the character has met more than once, or who feel strongly about them (any feeling at 2 or more
  either way), who are not in the scene and are not dead.
- **When.** Each story day that passes may bring one (the deck's beat chance at the drama level), up to MOST_DAYS a
  turn; and a beat comes at least every QUIET_TURNS lines, so a long scene does not freeze the world.
- **What it does.** Code applies the card: a fate (wounded, sick, captured, dead, turned, missing, …) that sticks
  to the person (the dead, captured, missing and conscripted are gone from town until something changes it), their
  feelings, rumors. The record keeps the truth as the world's; a death goes in as the world's death.
- **How the character learns of it.** Not at once: what the character would hear (the card's `seen`, as wrong as
  the card says) travels as word, and reaches them a day later on their next line in a town, into the journal as
  belief when it is not the whole truth. A card's rumor about the character or someone else travels the same way.
  With "meanwhile" cutaways on, the narrator also shows the player the beat as it happens.

`pressure` (a person's key) lets another system (the story director) ask for the next beat to land on someone.

All of it is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED); each line's beats are kept with it.
