"""The adult side of life (Settings > Realism > Adult side of life, off by default): who someone is drawn to,
how adventurous they are, their drive and a few things they're into, rolled from their seed like the rest of
their sheet. Only ever for adults, and the bank (world/data/intimacy.json) only holds things between
consenting adults.

- Townsfolk: nothing is stored. Their orientation is the roll their partner details use (world/dating.py), so
  the two always agree. Companions who meet them learn their orientation once they
  know their heart (dungeon/life/encounters.py); the rest stays theirs.
- Companions: the same roll by companion id (or by their townsperson's seed when they came from town), with
  anything the user set on the form (`definition['intimacy']`) winning field by field. A romance companion
  has no rolled orientation: they are drawn to the user.
- It only ever goes in the person's own chat prompt (dungeon/memory/context.py), as private lines. Never
  in picture prompts, the town paper, the feed or what other people see.

Nobody under 18 ever gets it: every roll checks the age itself, and a companion whose sheet reads as younger
than 18 gets nothing. No model is involved.
