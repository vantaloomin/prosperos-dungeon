"""The town paper: a short local paper for the companion's city, out every Sunday (the town paper, 2026-10-09).

It reports only what already happened or is already planned in the world, so it costs no model calls and two
reads of the same issue say the same thing: changes to the city (dungeon/world/changes.py), townsfolk who
reached a goal that week (dungeon/world/townsfolk.py), who left town, retired or took over a place's work and
which couples had a baby (dungeon/world/turnover.py, dungeon/world/couples.py), companions seen out at the city's venues, a gossip
column about companions who crossed paths with no names given (dungeon/life/encounters.py), and what's coming
up: annual events, holidays and the typical weather. Someone in a companion's circle who lived in the city and passed
away gets an obituary, as anyone in town would (dungeon/life/loss.py). Nothing else private goes in: no storylines,
no other circle news, no chat, nothing from the secrets ledger, and companions only by where anyone could have seen
them.

A period or fantasy city gets a gazette instead of a weekly; the wording stays plain either way.
