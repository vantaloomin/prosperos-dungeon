"""Character-sheet lines for a townsperson who becomes a companion (dungeon/cast.py), drawn by seed from a bank,
no model: what their work makes them good at, something they are only middling at, what makes them laugh or snap,
and a few habits of how they talk.

Work skills are found by the career's id (shared careers and every city's own), else the title they hold at a place
in town (the bartender, the sexton), else the career's sector, so a career a custom city adds still gets some. A
retired townsperson keeps the skills of the job they retired from (dungeon/world/life_details.py). The bank is
data (world/data/profile_bank.json), so it can grow without code changes.
