"""The town changes hands (Hit List #72, v0.14 Years Go By): townsfolk move away, change jobs, retire and, with
People can pass away on, pass away, and newcomers take their place at the bakery.

Every spot a townsperson fills (the first person at a place, the third neighbor on a street) is a slot, and
whoever holds it is one generation of it. The first generation is the person seeded there from the start
(dungeon/world/townsfolk.py); each newcomer is rebuilt from the slot's number plus STRIDE times their
generation, so `town:<city>:<place>:1003` is the third person to hold slot 3 after the first. Keys keep their four
parts and their number, and someone who left is still found by their key: a companion who knew them remembers.

How long someone stays is seeded a year at a time from when they arrived: each year of their stay rolls once
against their chances that year (moving away, a new job, retiring, passing away), which follow their life age (their
age in human terms, dungeon/world/lifespans.py: an elf seldom retires or passes away) and who they are, and a roll that comes up picks the week they go. A newcomer takes the spot that same week, so a place
never runs short of people and a street never has a gap. Nothing is stored, and there is no horizon: the same slot on the same day has the same person, however many years on.

Nobody had left before START, so towns people already knew don't lose anyone on upgrade. A companion is never
removed: the user's own townsperson and every companion made from a townsperson keep their slot for good
(`data['you']`, `data['kept']`), and a city pack's named people stay unless the pack lets them go
(schema.Notable.can_leave).

The pace follows Realism > Their days > Life's big turns and passing away follows People can pass away and the
Loss slider, and town babies (dungeon/world/couples.py) follow Growing families: `load` reads them from life
settings (columns `life_turns`, `people_pass_away`, `loss` and `growing_families`, read with defaults until those
settings exist) when a world opens. Call `load` again when they change. A change only moves the town on from the
week after it (`record`, table town_levels): each year of someone's stay rolls at the levels that held when that year
began, so who left before the change, and when, stays as it was.
