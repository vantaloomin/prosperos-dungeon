"""What someone looks like, as one sheet the same every time: the thing that keeps their pictures one person.

A sheet holds their apparent age, height, weight, build, skin, face shape, jaw and chin, nose, eye colour and
shape, hair, facial hair and one feature people notice. Height, build, hair, eye colour, facial hair and the
feature come from the townsperson's Matchlight looks (dungeon/world/dating.py), so a dating card, its photo
and every later picture agree; the rest is drawn here from the same seed. Colouring follows the heritage their
name or description comes from, and weight is worked out from height and build inside a plausible range
(`bmi_limits` in world/data/looks.json), so a roll never pairs 4'10" with 350 lb.

A companion's sheet works like "How others see them" (dungeon/world/perception.py): whatever the user set on
the form wins, field by field, and an empty field is drawn from the companion's id. Where the free-text
appearance already speaks of something (their hair, their eyes), the drawn value is left out, so the picture
never gets two hair colours. Nothing here calls a model.
