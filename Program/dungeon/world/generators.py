"""Deterministic generators that assemble everyday life from the shipped city data.

The same city data, seed and arguments always give the same result, on any machine and Python
version: choices come from SHA-256 of the seed, never from `random`. Callers pass a seed that is
stable for the moment being simulated (a slot key, for example), so a resumed or repeated batch
picks the same outing. Results are plain dictionaries with `refs`, the ids of every record used,
and `sources`, so an event can record exactly which facts it was built from. The model only
phrases these facts; it never has to invent a place, employer, rent or commute.
