"""Lifespans for elves and other long-lived people (Hit List #76, v0.15): each person has a kind, and each kind an
average lifespan. Nothing here calls a model.

Everyone keeps their real age (the one they say, the one the calendar moves, dungeon/life/ages.py). Beside it each
person has a life age: how far through life they are in human terms. Childhood runs at human pace for every kind,
and only adulthood is stretched to the kind's lifespan, so an elf (600 years) of 300 has a life age of 48. Every rule
that asks how old someone is for odds, life stages, retiring, health or passing away reads the life age; a human's
life age is their real age, so nothing changes for them.

The kinds are rule data (world/data/lifespans.json). A city file may carry its own `kinds` block, which changes a
built-in kind's lifespan for that city or adds the city's own kind, and a name group ties to a kind with
`"kind": "<key>"` (`clean` checks both when a city loads). Who gets which kind is decided by the app: a companion
or the user from what their own words say about them (`from_words`), a townsperson from their name group (`of_group`),
a circle relative from the companion. The user's own pick on their page wins over both (`lifespan_of`).
