"""The consequence engine: how a choice in the world turns out, from everything the app knows (2026-10-09).

Some things in the world have more than one way to go: whether two feuding friends make up, whether the
companion gets the promotion. Before, a blind coin flip picked when the storyline started. Now, when the
day comes, the engine reads the state that bears on it (how close the people are, how they know each other,
the companion's own description, the drama level), turns it into odds from a small table per choice
(world/data/consequences.json), rolls seeded dice against those odds and records the outcome with its odds
and reasons. Today shows them under "Why it went this way", and the user can change how it went.

No model decides anything and the model never sees the odds: the companion only hears what happened. Emotional
reactions come only from traits written into a character; the readers here look at words the user wrote.
Odds come from the tables alone, so the same world and seed always give the same result.
