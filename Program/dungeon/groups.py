"""Group chats: the user and several companions in one chat (docs/group-chat.md).

Each reply in a group is one ordinary model call for one companion, built from what that companion knows.
Every speaker's prompt starts with the same shared part, so the second and third speaker reuse the first
one's cached work:

1. the group rules (an editable prompt),
2. the cast: each member's name and public line, in join order,
3. the transcript as "Name: message" lines, written the same way for everyone and trimmed in chunks,

and only then the speaker's private part: their own 1:1 sections (memory/context.py, in its usual order) with
one `group` section, and the turn. Nothing personal goes above the transcript, or the prefix would differ for
every speaker.

The app decides everything here by rules: who is in a group, who sees which messages (`sees_from` and
`left_seq` on each stay), who answers and in what order. The model only writes the chosen speaker's line.

Seams the later group chat PRs build on:
- `public_line`: a member's "Others see" line in the cast block (world/perception.py).
- `group_lines`: the speaker's private group section (secrets, news, closeness between members, mood).
- `plan`, `weights` and `chime_in`: who answers whom (closeness between members; nobody answers someone they
  aren't speaking to, dungeon/moods.py).
- Members are person keys (`companion:<id>`); guests from a member's circle or the town join under their own keys
  (dungeon/group_guests.py), with a short rule-made sheet in place of the 1:1 sections.

Groups also start conversations on their own: a member shares something from their day and the others answer
it as they answer the user (`GroupChats.first_words`; the rules are in dungeon/group_openers.py).

from the app about who joined or left, not messages.
- Everyone in the group reads every message sent while they are in it. Nobody knows what was said in private \
chats they were not part of, or in the group before they could see it.
- You are told below which one of these people you are, with what only that person knows. Write only that \
person's next message: one message, in their own voice, with no name in front of it. Never write lines for \
anyone else.
- Talk to the whole group or to one person in it, and keep it as short as a real group text unless the moment \
needs more."""
