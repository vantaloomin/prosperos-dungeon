"""NPCs keep secrets and lie, and detection is rolled (requirements "NPCs keep secrets and lie").

When the player's line questions someone in the scene who has something to hide, code decides they lie, and rolls
the character's insight (Mind, in any ruleset: dungeon/sheet.py check) against how practised a liar they are: a
city's notables are hard to read, anyone else normal. Caught, the narrator shows the tell; believed, the narrator
writes the lie with no tell, and the record keeps the lie as the world's truth only, hidden from the character
(the narrator's words to the character go in as their belief, dungeon/record.py).

Something to hide is a notable's `secret`, wants that keep something hidden ("nobody asking questions", "without
ever saying why"), or the hidden truth of an open job they gave. Someone who trusts the character (feelings trust
TRUSTING or more) tells them the truth. Each person is read once a story day: the rest of the day they keep to the
lie the character believed, or are known to be lying (story_cards, scene 'lie', card_id the person's key).
