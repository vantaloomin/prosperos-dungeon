"""The director, full: seeds and payoffs, adopted details and arc beats planned a stage at a time (requirements "The
director"; docs/story.md "The director: seeds, adopted details and planned beats"). Director v0 is dungeon/director.py.

- **Seeds pay off (the Chekhov list, story_seeds).** Every seed the GM note plants is logged against its thread and
  the hidden truth it points to, with a payoff window of WINDOW lines. Code checks after each narration which
  planted seeds reached the page (by their words). When a seed's thread is hot or its arc is due, or its window is
  closing, the note asks for it to come back; once it does, it is paid. A seed whose window ends unpaid is retired,
  and the GM view shows it so; the player can also cash one in (ask for it next) or retire it there.
- **Adopted details.** When the Continuity model says the player's line engaged with something the narrator made up
  (a stranger at the bar, a symbol on a door), the director may give it a meaning tied to the hottest arc thread:
  the director model drafts it when one is chosen, else code ties it to the thread's own truth. The meaning is
  checked against the record (nothing about the dead acting) and kept as hidden truth and as a seed already on the
  page, so it pays off like any other.
- **Beats planned a stage at a time, Mabry style (story_arc_beats).** When an arc reaches a stage with no plan, the
  director model (job `director`, off unless chosen) drafts BEATS candidate beats from the stage's truth, the hottest
  threads and the world's own beats; code keeps those that name none of the dead and stay within the stage, and
  falls back to the stage's own seed and word. The plan is hidden; with the GM view on, the player can cut and
  reorder it. When the arc is due, the note gives the next beat.

All of it is game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
