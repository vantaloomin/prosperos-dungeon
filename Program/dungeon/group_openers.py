"""Group chats start conversations on their own (Everyone keeps living).

Now and then someone in a group shares something from their own day, and the others answer it the way they
answer the user (dungeon/groups.py: who answers, the pace, secrets). Rules decide everything: which group, who
speaks and what about (a committed event from their own life in the last day that this group hasn't heard, and
that gives away no secret someone there must not find out); the model only writes the lines.

It follows the holds of one-to-one first messages (dungeon/life/openers.py): the texts_first setting, pause,
quiet hours, the speaker's sleep and the shared away allowance (dungeon/away.py), which the opening line draws
from. And per group: never while the user is in the middle of a chat, never within `texts_gap_hours` of the
group's last message, never twice without the user answering, and at most once every `EVERY`.
