"""Author's note: a short note of the user's that rides along with every reply in one chat (Hit List #48).

One note per chat; the story (`story`) is the only chat there is now. While it is on, it goes last in the notes sent
with the message being answered, right before the user's own words, so it is the last thing the model reads; it sits in
the volatile tail and leaves the cached part of the prompt alone. It is never a message: not in the transcript,
not read for memories, not exported, and an out-of-character message (OOC:) is answered without it.

The wording around the note is an editable prompt (Settings > Advanced > Prompts, "Author's note").
