"""Fights under Ironsworn (docs/requirements.md "Combat": "Ironsworn keeps Health and harm"; docs/story.md "Fights
under Ironsworn").

The fight runs as dungeon/combat.py does (one player line is one round, the defeat table by what the foes want),
with Ironsworn's moves from the pack:
- **Foes are the pack's NPCs**, read from a foe's name (a raider is a Raider, a wolf a Wolf, a ley-mad boar a Boar),
  else by how tough the MARVEL spec is. Each has its rank, the harm it deals (its rank) and a progress track of ten
  boxes that the character's harm fills: a troublesome foe takes 3 boxes a harm, dangerous 2, formidable 1,
  extreme 2 ticks, epic 1 tick.
- **Initiative.** A fight the character starts gives them initiative; a danger's foe has it. With initiative the
  character's attack is Strike: a strong hit inflicts +1 harm and keeps initiative, a weak hit inflicts harm and
  loses it, a miss loses it. Without, it is Clash: a strong hit inflicts harm and takes initiative, a weak hit
  inflicts harm and the foe strikes back, a miss and the foe strikes. Harm is 1, 2 with a deadly weapon (a sword,
  an axe, a bow).
- **End the Fight.** After a strong hit, once a foe's track has PROGRESS_TRY boxes, code makes the decisive move: the
  challenge dice against the boxes. A strong hit and the foe is out of the fight; a weak hit too, and the character
  Endures Harm; a miss and they pay for it, enduring harm, and the fight goes on.
- **Foes with initiative attack**: the character Endures Harm, -health by the foe's rank, then rolls +health or
  +iron: a strong hit takes +1 momentum, a miss -1. At 0 health a miss means Face Death (+heart): a strong hit and
  death rejects them (the defeat table without death), a weak hit the same with a cost, a miss is death.
- **Health** reads as the game's wound levels (5 unharmed to 0 at death's door, WORDS), and a wound dealt outside a
  fight lowers health to match. **Rest** (Make Camp, a night's sleep) gives +1 health a night, as written.
