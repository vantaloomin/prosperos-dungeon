"""A whole character the user already has, split into the form's fields, and the fields the sidecar may change.

`split` takes a pasted character (or one read from a character card) and splits it into the form's fields
with one model call, when the user asks. Their text wins over the drafting guidance; fields it says
nothing about are filled in and named, so the form can show which ones to check. It reuses the drafting
checks in dungeon/drafting.py: the Character drafting job, the one-retry repair, the field shaping and
the invented-name check. The world stays the app's: a city is only ever one from the catalogue that the
pasted text names. Nothing is saved. See docs/character-drafting.md; the sidecar is dungeon/sidecar.py.
