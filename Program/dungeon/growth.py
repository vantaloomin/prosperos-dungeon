"""Progression (requirements "Progression"; docs/story.md "Progression").

MARVEL characters grow by use, plus milestones, and dark tracks bite.

- **Use.** A roll of the character's that mattered (one that succeeded, or one with a danger riding on it) marks its
  stat. After a night's rest, code rolls for each marked stat, Basic Roleplaying style: over GROW times the stat on
  a d100, the stat rises a point, so a high stat grows slowly. The marks clear either way.
- **Milestones.** A town's own quest done, or a rise in tier (dungeon/tiers.py), gives MILESTONE points to the stat
  the character has used most since the last one.
- **Dark tracks** (rules/dark.json: corruption, addiction, infamy). Code raises them: Life Cards' `corruption`
  effects, and what the Continuity model saw the character do each turn (a pact, a drug, a public atrocity). Each
  threshold grants power (a stat boost) and rolls a lasting change to body, mind or how people treat them, among
  those the intensity settings allow; the top of a track costs the player the character.

Marks, uses and dark tracks are game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
