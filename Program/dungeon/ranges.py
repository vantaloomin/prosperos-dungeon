"""Range bands and named areas in a fight (requirements "Combat": "Positioning: zones, grid optional").

Every ruleset keeps each foe at a range band, engaged, near or far, and the fight keeps the named area the character
fights from ("the stairs", "the bar"):
- A foe not engaged spends its turn closing one band (far to near, near to engaged), unless it fights at range (a
  danger's archers, `ranged` in its spec): then it shoots from where it stands.
- The character's blow reaches a near foe (and engages it) but not a far one: the line closes to near instead. A
  shot or a throw reaches any band and leaves the target where it is.
- A line that backs off ("I fall back to the stairs", "I step back out of reach") and lands its roll breaks away from
  every engaged foe, who must close again; one that names a place to go moves the fight's area there. A move to a
  place this way is not an escape: running away is (dungeon/combat.py FLEE).
