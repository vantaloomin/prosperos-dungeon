"""Institutions: a school, a guild, an army the character belongs to (requirements "Quests and factions": institutions
are factions, their demands are quests, the result is a track; docs/story.md "Institutions").

Each world's institutions are in world/data/institutions/<world>.json (or its package's engine data).

- **Enrolment.** A premade's `enrolled` names the institution and classes they start in; a character made in a
  world with a `default` institution starts in it with its `core` classes. The player can join or leave later.
- **Terms and the class schedule.** Classes meet on fixed days and hours during each term (month and day, every
  year, or once on set dates). When the story clock passes a class's start while the character is enrolled in it, they were there if the
  scene is at the class's place (or anywhere in the institution's town when the class names no place), and missed it
  otherwise. Skipping is a real choice: each class missed is in the record and pulls the term's attendance down.
- **Demands are quests.** Recurring demands (`every_days`: assignments, labs, club duties, a guild's dues) and
  once-a-term ones (`week`: exams) open as quests with deadlines on the story clock, tied to the institution.
  The Continuity model decides whether each is done, as for any quest (dungeon/quests.py).
- **Grades.** Each settled demand is a mark (done 90, failed 60, missed 0), weighted; attendance is one more mark
  with its own weight. The term's weighted average gives a letter and a grade point (A 4.0 to F 0). A demand failed
  or missed costs standing with the institution's faction; one done earns the work's share of the tier track like
  any job (dungeon/tiers.py).
- **The narrator is told** what is on today (and when), what is due and how the character's grades stand, and never
  invents a class or a deadline that is not here.

Enrolment, attendance and grades are game state, branched with the story (dungeon/timeline.py SAVED).
