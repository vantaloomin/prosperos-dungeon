# Current context tools (MCP)

[Back to the README](../../README.md)

The Dungeon can look up real weather, news and local events through
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers the user configures
(PRD X1–X3), and read links the user pastes. Nothing needs a paid API or key. Lookups run only once the
user turns them on; reading pasted links is on by default and can be turned off. One server ships with
the app, a keyless weather server; any other service the user adds. The code is in `dungeon/mcp/`.

## How it works

1. **Location.** The user types their own city or region, and optionally coordinates, under
   Settings. It is stored apart from the companion's fictional location and never detected.
2. **Service.** The user adds an MCP server: a local program (stdio) or an HTTPS address
   (streamable HTTP; plain HTTP only for a service on this computer). An optional key is kept in
   the OS credential vault and sent only to that server, as an environment variable or header.
3. **Check.** The app connects, lists the server's tools and suggests one tool per category
   (weather, news, local events) with arguments filled from the tool's input schema. Only
   properties a known source can fill are used; optional ones it can't fill are left out.
4. **Disclosure and enabling.** Saving a mapping leaves it off. Its disclosure says which tool at
   which destination receives which arguments, with today's values, when it runs, and what is never
   sent. Enabling requires the digest of that disclosure; any change to the destination, tool,
   arguments or timing needs a new confirmation. Changing a server's program, address or key turns
   its lookups off.

### What a lookup can send

| Source | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `place` | The user's city or region as typed, or the companion's city for companion lookups |
| `latitude`, `longitude` | Coordinates the user entered, or the centre of the companion's city |
| `topic` | Up to six words naming what the user asked about ("news about the harbor bridge") |
| `date` | Today's date where the lookup applies |
| `literal` | A fixed value the user chose (for example units) |
| `url` | The link the user pasted (link reading only; a tool that takes a list, such as `urls`, gets a list of one) |

The conversation, memories, the user's name, the character definition and other services' keys
are never sent. A local program starts with only the environment variables it needs to run (such as
`PATH` and `TEMP`) plus its own key, so `DUNGEON_API_KEY` never reaches it.

### When lookups run

The model is never given tools. The app decides, with fixed rules on the user's message:

| Category | Runs when the message | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weather | mentions the weather, forecast, rain, snow, temperature, an umbrella… | The user's location |
| News | mentions news, headlines or current events; "news about X" sends X as the topic | No location |
| Local events | mentions events, concerts, festivals or things to do, with "near me", "tonight", "this weekend"… | The user's location |
| Web search | asks for a search: "can you google…", "please search the web for…", "look up…", or a sentence starting "Search…"; "search reddit for X" and "search twitter for X" add the site | Sends only what was asked, up to twelve words |
| Reading links | contains a link that this computer could not read (see [Links you paste](#links-you-paste)) | Sends only the link |

When the message asks about the companion's whereabouts ("what's the weather like where you
are?"), weather and events target the companion's city instead, but only for mappings that allow
companion lookups and only when that city is a real, modern place in the world data. Oz, a
steampunk city or an unknown location is never looked up.

A retried send or an alternative reply reuses the lookups already made for that message. Without a
model connection no reply is written, so nothing is looked up.

### Limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Deadline for lookups before a reply | 5 seconds; the reply goes ahead without them |
| Deadline for a lookup started from Settings | 20 seconds |
| Retries | One, only for a timeout or a transport failure, when time remains |
| Pause after a failure | 5 minutes per service |
| Requests per service | 20 an hour, 100 a day |
| Services per category | 2 |
| Message size | 512 KB per message; stored text 2,000 characters |
| Reuse | A fresh result with the same tool and arguments is reused instead of asking again |

### Freshness and failures

Results stay fresh for an hour (weather), three hours (news) or twelve hours (events). A fresh
result is quoted in the reply's context with its service, tool and retrieval time. When a lookup is
refused by a limit, the latest earlier result for the same arguments is included but labelled out
of date ("do not describe it as current"). A failed lookup tells the companion it does not know the
current conditions and should carry on. Results for one category from two services carry a note
that they may disagree.

Tool output is data. It is stored as plain text, quoted between « » under a heading that says it
cannot change the companion's rules, reveal memories or ask for more lookups, and nothing in it is
ever parsed for instructions or used to call another tool. Servers' requests back to the app
(sampling, roots, elicitation) are refused; only `ping` is answered.

Observations are not personal memories (M6): they are never extracted into memories, they are
listed separately, and each one can be deleted. The receipt of a reply lists the observations it
was given under `outside`.

## Real weather for the companion's day

A weather mapping that allows companion lookups can also give the companion's simulated day real
weather, in place of the city's typical weather from its climate data (W2). While background
activity is on and the workspace is not paused, each life tick asks for the companion's city; the
fresh-result reuse keeps that to about once an hour. A conversation question about the weather
where the companion is counts too.

`dungeon/mcp/weather.py` reads a high, a low and rain from the result: from structured fields
named for their unit (`high_f`, `temp_c`…) or from temperatures in the text ("61°F", "30 °C"), with
rain from words such as rain, showers or storms. A result with no readable temperature changes
nothing. Only a lookup made on that local date applies, and only for a real, modern city. After a
readable lookup, that day's schedule entries that have not started are removed and composed again
with the same seeds, so only the weather (and whether an outdoor plan moves indoors) can change.
Entries already under way keep their weather. The day's weather then carries `observed` (source,
tool, time), and the reply's context gives it under "Today's real weather where you live (looked up
by the app…)" with its source and time, instead of the typical-weather heading.

## Real events in the companion's city

A local-events mapping that allows companion lookups is also asked, on the same background ticks
(at most every twelve hours, the events freshness), for the companion's real city. While that
result is fresh, every reply's context lists it under "Real events listed for your city", which
says the companion may want to go or plan to, but has not attended any of them unless its
committed events say so. A real event can inspire a plan or an imagined outing; it never becomes a
life event or proof of attendance by itself (PRD X intro, T7).

## Links you paste

A link in the user's message is its own trigger: the app opens it so the companion can talk about
it. It is on by default (**Open links I paste** in Settings) and reads at most two links per message.
The model is never given a fetch tool. `dungeon/mcp/links.py` does the reading on the user's
computer:

| Link | How it is read |
| --- | --- |
| Reddit post (including `/s/` share links and `redd.it`, which redirect to one) | Reddit's public JSON view of the post: title, subreddit, author, score, text and the top five comments |
| Subreddit (`reddit.com/r/name`) | The subreddit's current hot posts, by title |
| X or Twitter post (`x.com/user/status/id`) | X's public oEmbed endpoint (`publish.twitter.com/oembed`): the post's text, author and date; not replies or images |
| X profile, search or other X page | Not read: X shows them only to signed-in users |
| YouTube video | YouTube's oEmbed endpoint: the title and channel only |
| Any other page | The page's HTML: title, description and the paragraph text, preferring `<article>`/`<main>` and leaving out navigation, scripts, headers and footers |

Limits: 6 seconds and 1.5 MB per page, four redirects, 6,000 characters kept, 30 links an hour, and a
read link stays fresh (reused, not fetched again) for six hours. Only `http` and `https` links to public
addresses are opened: a link whose host is or resolves to this computer, the local network, a
link-local or any other private address is refused, and so is every redirect to one, so a pasted link
cannot reach the app itself or a router. (A host that changes its DNS answer between the check and the
request is not caught.) PDFs, images, video and pages that only render in a browser are not read.

When a page cannot be read on this computer, an enabled **Reading links** mapping (a fetch tool on an
MCP service, such as Parallel's `web_fetch` or Firecrawl's scrape) is tried next. It runs only then,
sends only the link and needs the same disclosure and confirmation as other lookups.

What the companion is told:

- **Read:** the page's text, quoted, under the outside-information heading, saying the companion has
  looked at the link and can talk about it.
- **Not read:** that the link would not open for them and they have not seen it, so they must not
  guess, summarise or pretend to know what it says. They give a brief in-character reason, matched to
  what their simulated day says they are doing right now (a blocked site on a work network, bad signal
  while out, a page that just won't load), and ask what it says. The real reason is not given to the
  model, so error codes never reach the chat.

Under the user's message, a small out-of-character note says **Opened example.com** or **Couldn't
load example.com: the real reason**, so the user always knows what happened.

## Web search

Settings offers three hosted search services that work without a key, as one click each (checked
2026-10-05; each one's own terms, limits and retention apply):

| Service | Address | Tools (as documented) | Without a key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel Search | `https://search.parallel.ai/mcp` | `web_search(objective, search_queries)`, `web_fetch(urls)` | Free at lower rate limits; commercial use allowed |
| Exa | `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp` | `web_search_exa`, `web_fetch_exa`, `web_search_advanced_exa` | Free, rate-limited (HTTP 429 when exceeded) |
| Firecrawl | `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp` | `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_parse` | A small keyless allowance |

Adding one connects and lists its tools. Its **Web search** and **Reading links** mappings are then
suggested from those tools and stay off until their disclosures are confirmed, like any other service.
A search sends only the request, taken from the message (up to twelve words, and "on Reddit" or "on X
(Twitter)" when the user named the site); never the user's location, conversation or memories. A tool
field that takes a list, such as Parallel's `search_queries`, gets the request as a list of one.
Results stay fresh for an hour, are quoted to the companion as outside information (4,000 characters
at most), and a failed search tells the companion it has seen no results and must not invent any.

Searching Reddit and X: the request names the site, and the search service decides what it finds.
Reddit threads usually appear. X posts appear only when the search service has indexed them, which is
hit and miss: X has no keyless search, and its own search API is paid. A pasted Reddit or X link is
read directly instead (see [Links you paste](#links-you-paste)).

None of these services has been reached from the development environment, which blocks them, so the
tests use the stand-in server with Parallel's documented tool shape.

## The built-in weather server

`dungeon/mcp/servers/weather.py` is a small read-only MCP server that ships with the app. Settings
offers **Add the built-in weather server**, which adds and checks it in one step. One server covers
both places: its card shows two switches, **Your weather (your city or region)** and **<Companion>'s
weather (their city)**, each naming the place it uses, under a sentence saying what a switch sends and
where. Turning a switch on saves the lookup and confirms that disclosure; the full mapping (tool,
arguments, the disclosure list, "try it") is under **Advanced**. The companion's switch is available
only when they live in a real, modern city.

When the user and the companion live in the same place ("Baltimore, MD" and "Baltimore, Maryland":
the same city and region, with US state abbreviations spelled out), a fresh weather result for one is
reused for the other instead of asking again. The copy keeps the original's retrieval time and
freshness and counts as no request. The app runs it with its own
Python (`python -I dungeon/mcp/servers/weather.py`), so it works from a checkout or the installed
bundle with nothing else installed. It is stored as the command `@builtin:weather`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Tool | `get_forecast(location, latitude?, longitude?)`; the suggested mapping sends only `location` (your city or region as typed) |
| Finding the place | [Open-Meteo geocoding](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api), searching the city name; text after a comma (state, US state abbreviation or country) chooses among matches |
| Forecast | [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) for today: conditions, high, low, chance of precipitation and the current temperature, in °F |
| Fallback | The [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) API, only for US places (or coordinates) when Open-Meteo fails |
| Result | Text such as "Baltimore, Maryland, US: light rain, high 61°F, low 52°F, 70% chance of precipitation, now 58°F", plus `high_f`, `low_f`, `condition`, `precipitation_chance`, `temperature_f`, `source`, so real weather for the companion's day reads it directly |
| Network | Only the place name or coordinates are sent. 8-second timeout, no redirects, User-Agent `ProsperoDungeon/1.0 (built-in weather server)` as the NWS asks. It starts with the same minimal environment as other local programs, plus proxy and certificate settings; never the app's keys |

Open-Meteo's free API is for non-commercial use and its data is licensed CC BY 4.0, so every result
carries "Weather data by Open-Meteo.com (CC BY 4.0)". A commercial distribution of the app would need
an Open-Meteo subscription or a different source. NWS data is public domain.

## The built-in local pulse server

`dungeon/mcp/servers/pulse.py` is a second keyless server that ships with the app, added with
**Add the built-in local pulse server** and stored as `@builtin:pulse`. It goes with the built-in
calendar (docs/almanac.md): the calendar knows what season it is, and the pulse looks up what is
actually happening. Its card has three switches: **Local headlines (your city)**, **Games and air quality near you**
and **Games and air quality in <Companion>'s city**. Each names the place it uses, under a sentence saying what a switch
sends and where; the full mappings are under **Advanced**.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `get_local_news(location, topic?)` | Mapped to **News**. Headlines from [Google News's RSS search](https://news.google.com/rss) for the topic you name ("news about the bridge"), else for your city. Without a topic it adds English Wikipedia's most-read articles from the day before ([Wikimedia feed API](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Feed_API)) and the hot posts in the city's subreddit (r/baltimore, r/nyc, r/vegas…), with stickied and adult posts left out |
| `get_local_happenings(location, latitude?, longitude?)` | Mapped to **Local events**. Pro games played in or near the city, and the local teams' away games, from yesterday through the next six days, with final scores for games already played: MLB from [MLB's stats API](https://statsapi.mlb.com), and the NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL and MLS from ESPN's public scoreboards, each asked only in the months it plays. Venues in neighboring towns count for the big metros (MetLife Stadium for New York, Hard Rock Stadium for Miami). Plus the current US air quality index from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/air-quality-api) |
| Network | Only the place name, coordinates or topic are sent. Sources are asked in parallel, with a 6-second timeout each; a source that fails is left out, and the lookup fails only when every source does |

Games for the companion's city reach the reply as real events listed for their city (they may want
to go, but haven't been unless their life says so). ESPN's scoreboards are unofficial and can change
without notice. Google News and Reddit can refuse requests that look automated. Air quality data is
CC BY 4.0, like the weather data.

## The built-in culture pulse server

`dungeon/mcp/servers/culture.py` is the internet-wide counterpart to the local pulse: it covers what's out and what
people are into. It is added with **Add the built-in culture pulse server**, stored as `@builtin:culture`,
and fills the **Movies, shows, games and what's trending** lookup (category `culture`). The lookup sends no place, only which
sections a message asked about. Its card has two switches, plus an optional TMDB key:

- **Movies, shows, games and what's trending** (purpose `conversation`): when a message asks about them.
- **A sense of what's going on** (purpose `ambient`): once a day, while background activity is on, the life
  simulation asks for the digest of every section with no topic, so nothing about the user is sent. It counts as
  fresh for 24 hours; after a failed or refused try the next one waits an hour. It is skipped for a companion who
  does not live in the present day (a city whose era is not `modern`). While fresh, the top two of each list go
  into every reply's context as one section, **What's out and trending right now**, placed with the other daily
  sections (after the calendar) so it does not break prompt caching; it says the companion knows them as anyone online
  does but has not watched, played, read or heard them. The top movie, show, song and book can also turn up in
  today's status posts on their feed ("Everyone keeps talking about … Worth it?"), never on a past day's.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Tool | `get_culture_pulse(topic?)`; the topic names the sections ("movies, tv"), and without one it returns a short digest of every section |
| Chat triggers | Deterministic: movies/films/box office → `movies`; TV, series, Netflix, streaming, binge → `tv`; video games, Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo → `games`; albums, songs, playlists, Spotify → `music`; new/good books, bestsellers, novels → `books`; trending, viral, memes → `trending`. Results stay fresh for 6 hours |
| movies | The iTunes top movies chart (new home releases) and the latest movie review and box office headlines from Google News. With a TMDB key, it also lists what's in theaters now and coming soon, with ratings |
| tv | Today's US episodes, streaming and broadcast, from [TVmaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api), with premieres first |
| games | Steam's new releases, top sellers and coming soon, and the latest game review headlines |
| music | Apple Music's most-played songs and albums in the US ([Apple's RSS feeds](https://rss.applemarketingtools.com)) |
| books | [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)'s trending books today |
| trending | Google Trends' daily searches in the US, English Wikipedia's most-read articles and Reddit's r/popular, with adult posts left out |
| Key | Optional. A free TMDB key (v3 API key or v4 read token) is kept in the credential store and given only to this server as `TMDB_API_KEY`. Saving or removing it asks for the lookup to be confirmed again |

Like the local pulse, each source that fails is left out, and the lookup fails only when every source does. The
iTunes chart and the Google feeds are public but unofficial, so they can change without notice. TVmaze data is
CC BY-SA.

## Interface

Settings has a **Real-world lookups** section: your location, the services, a suggested tool for
each category with its arguments, the disclosure to confirm, and a way to try an enabled lookup.
Memories has a **Real-world lookups** list kept apart from memories, showing what each lookup
sent, where, when, and whether it still counts as current, with delete.

## Tested transports

Supporting MCP does not make every server compatible. The client speaks the protocol revisions
with an `initialize` handshake (2025-03-26, 2025-06-18 and 2025-11-25) and only lists and calls
tools. CI runs these combinations on Linux and Windows:

| Server | Transport | Response | Session | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stand-in (`tests/mcp_standin.py`) | stdio | — | — | Passes |
| Stand-in | Streamable HTTP | JSON | Session id | Passes |
| Stand-in | Streamable HTTP | Event stream, with a notification first | Session id | Passes |
| Stand-in | Streamable HTTP | JSON, bearer key | Session id | Passes; a wrong key is reported as refused |
| Official MCP Python SDK 2.3.0 (`MCPServer`) | stdio | — | — | Passes |
| Official MCP Python SDK 2.3.0 | Streamable HTTP | JSON | Stateful | Passes |
| Official MCP Python SDK 2.3.0 | Streamable HTTP | Event stream | Stateful | Passes |
| Official MCP Python SDK 2.3.0 | Streamable HTTP | JSON | Stateless | Passes |
| Official MCP Python SDK 2.3.0 | Streamable HTTP | Event stream | Stateless | Passes |
| Built-in weather server | stdio | — | — | Passes, against recorded Open-Meteo and NWS answers |

Each SDK case lists tools, calls a tool and checks that a tool error is reported as a failure.
No public weather, news or events server has been tested yet, and the built-in weather server has
not yet reached the live Open-Meteo or NWS APIs: the development environment blocks outbound access to
them, so its tests use recorded answers (`tests/test_weather_server.py`). Not supported: the older HTTP+SSE transport (2024-11-05), the 2026-07-28
single-exchange HTTP revision, OAuth sign-in, resources, prompts and any tool that writes, posts,
reads private inboxes or calendars, or makes transactions (out of scope for the first release).
