# Worlds and personas

A **persona** is the user as someone in particular: a name, gender, age, birthday and a few lines about them. A
**world** is everything that happened to one persona there: the story, the people met and the town. Each persona
has one or more worlds. Two worlds can share a city: each seeds its own townsfolk (`persona.town_seed`, set once
when the world is made), so the same streets hold different people.

## Where things live

- Each world is its own workspace database in its own folder. The first world keeps the data folder's own
  `dungeon.sqlite3` (`Database.root`, `Database.home`); every other world is `worlds/<id>/dungeon.sqlite3`, with
  its own `backups/` beside it.
- `worlds.json` in the data folder lists personas and worlds and which world is active (`dungeon/worlds.py`). It
  is written whole and swapped in.
- Shared by every world, in the data folder: downloaded models (`voice/`, `embeddings/`), logs, city packs and
  `worlds.json`.
- Each world's `persona` table holds the persona it belongs to, copied from `worlds.json` whenever the world opens
  or the persona changes.

## Switching

`POST /api/worlds/{id}/switch` (or `/api/worlds/personas/{id}/switch`, the persona's most recent world) refuses
while debug time is on. It checkpoints the current database, points the app's one `Database` at the other file
(`Database.use`), carries the user's settings across (`worlds.SHARED`: restore's kept settings minus debug time,
plus the user's own cities) and writes the persona. The interface reloads.

Work already under way stays in its own world. Each request and each background task is pinned to the world open
when it began (`Database.pin`, a context variable that every task it starts inherits), so a reply that comes back
from a model after the switch is stored where it was asked for. Pages send the world they show
(`X-Dungeon-World`); a tab still showing the old world gets `409 world_changed` for anything it asks and reloads
into the new one, rather than writing into it.

## Defaults

- A new workspace is the first world, in Kingswood, with a blank persona.
- A new world starts in the current city (or `city_id`, or "Somewhere new", a featured city picked for it) with
  fresh townsfolk.
- The persona is the user's to say (Vanta, 2026-10-09). "New persona" opens the persona form; the name they type
  is required, anything left blank stays blank, and the app makes nothing up. Their world is still decided for
  them, as above.

## Deleting

A world can be deleted unless it is active or the first world (which holds the others). A verified backup goes to
`backups/deleted-worlds/` in the data folder first. A persona goes with all its worlds, unless it is active or owns
the first world.

## Automatic backups

`dungeon/auto_backup.py` backs up every world on its own while the app runs: daily by default
(`workspace_settings.auto_backups`: `daily`, `weekly` or `off`, Settings > Data), first a couple of minutes after
a start, then checked every 15 minutes. A world unchanged since its last automatic backup is skipped. Archives go
to the world's own `backups/` as `auto-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.zip`; the newest of each of the last 7 days with one and of
each of the 4 weeks before are kept. It never calls a model.
