# Phone access

The Dungeon can be used from a phone, at home or away, through [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). The
server keeps listening only on this PC (`127.0.0.1:8785`). `tailscale serve` gives it a private https address
on your tailnet, such as `https://home-vanta.tail1234.ts.net`, that only devices signed in to your Tailscale
account can open. Nothing is opened to the internet or your router. The PC has to be on and awake for a phone
to reach it.

## Setting it up

1. Install Tailscale on the PC and on the phone, and sign in to both with the same account.
2. In the Dungeon on the PC, open Settings > Phone access and choose **Turn on phone access**. This runs
   `tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:<port>`. The first time, Tailscale may ask you to allow https
   certificates for your tailnet; the Dungeon shows the link it gives. It also runs
   `tailscale serve --bg --http=<port> http://127.0.0.1:<port>` for the backup address (below).
3. Choose **Pair a phone** and scan the QR code with the phone's camera, or open the link and type the code.
   A code works once, for ten minutes.
4. On the phone, use the browser's Add to Home Screen to install it like an app.

Turning phone access off runs `tailscale serve --https=443 off` and `tailscale serve --http=<port> off`, and refuses
phones until it is turned on again.
Paired phones are listed in Settings > Phone access, where each can be removed; a phone can also sign itself out.

## If nothing opens on the phone

Settings > Phone access lists the phones and tablets signed in to your tailnet and says when none is, or when
Tailscale is switched off on them; that is the usual reason the link opens and nothing loads. It also warns when
MagicDNS is off for the tailnet, since the phone then cannot look up the PC's name. Under the QR code, **If nothing
opens on the phone** walks through the rest:

- The first visit can take up to a minute while Tailscale fetches the https certificate.
- The **backup address** is the PC's tailnet address over plain http, such as `http://100.90.1.2:8785`. It needs
  neither MagicDNS nor a certificate, and Tailscale still encrypts the traffic between the devices. Pairing works
  there the same way (the device cookie is then not marked Secure, since the browser would drop it over http).
  Phone notifications need the https address, as browsers only offer push to secure pages.
- If only the backup address works, the phone looks names up without Tailscale: on Android, Private DNS set to a
  provider name does this; in the Tailscale app, Use Tailscale DNS should stay on.

## On your home Wi-Fi, without Tailscale

**Use on home Wi-Fi** in Settings > Phone access is off by default. Turned on, it opens a second listener on port
8786 (or `DUNGEON_LAN_PORT`) on every network the PC is on, so a phone on the same Wi-Fi can open
`http://<the PC's address>:8786`; the app's own port stays on this PC only. It stays on across restarts until
turned off; restoring a backup keeps it as it is (only a restore onto a new computer turns it off). Windows or macOS may ask once whether to let the Dungeon accept
connections; allow it on private networks.

Every request through that listener counts as a phone's, whatever headers it carries: it needs the switch on and a
paired device (the same pairing codes), and the PC-only list below applies. Only requests from, and naming, a
private home address (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, link-local, fc00::/7) are answered, so a forwarded port or a
renamed host is refused. It is plain http: anyone else on the same network could read what passes or copy a phone's
sign-in cookie, so the switch warns to use it only on a trusted home network. Notifications need the Tailscale https
address. Routers with client (AP) isolation keep phones from reaching the PC; Tailscale works there.

## What a phone may do

A request is from a phone when it arrives through the Tailscale proxy (forwarded headers, or a host name other
than this PC). It needs phone access to be on, a `*.ts.net` host name or a Tailscale address (100.64.0.0/10 or
fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48), and the cookie of a paired device. Only a
hash of each device's token is stored.

A paired phone can chat and use Today, Memories, Character and most of Settings. These stay on the PC,
because they run programs or read files there, restore data, or could send a saved API key to a new address:

- Phone access itself (turning it on or off, pairing, removing phones)
- Backups and restores, and importing from Prospero's Study
- Changing model connections and profiles, real-world lookup services, image backends, and LoRA training
  settings, runs and adapter imports (these can still be viewed)

Restoring a backup turns phone access off and unpairs every phone.

## On the phone

The interface has a bottom tab bar on narrow screens, leaves room for a notch and home bar, keeps the keyboard
from covering the message box, and opens a message's actions in a sheet from the bottom of the screen when the message is pressed and held (Copy, Edit, Branch from here and the rest), as phone messaging apps do.

## Notifications on a phone

In Settings > Notifications on a paired phone, **Notify this phone** subscribes it to Web Push (RFC 8030). The PC
encrypts each notification for that phone (RFC 8291) and sends it to the phone's push service (Apple's or
Google's), signed with a key kept in the OS credential vault (VAPID, RFC 8292). The push service carries it but
cannot read it. On an iPhone this needs iOS 16.4 or later and the Dungeon opened from the home screen.

What a notification says and when it comes are decided as on the PC: quiet hours, the daily cap, the gap
between notifications and the preview setting all apply. Every notification the PC shows also goes to subscribed
phones. When no window is asking, the Dungeon checks once a minute and sends to phones itself, but holds off
while the Dungeon is open and focused on the PC. The PC has to be on. Removing a phone, or a push service
saying a subscription is gone, stops its notifications. The service worker (`public/sw.js`) caches nothing.
