# Life simulation API

[Back to the README](../../README.md) · [Architecture](architecture.md)

These endpoints back the interface's Today and Feed views. All times are UTC ISO 8601 strings
with an offset; display them in the user's timezone (`GET /api/settings` → `user_timezone`) or the
companion's (`GET /api/companion` → `version.timezone`). Writes need the
`x-dungeon-client: workspace` header, like the rest of the API.

`user_timezone` follows this PC unless the user picks one (`user_timezone_source`: `default`, `pc` or
`chosen`). On startup the backend sets it from the Windows registry (mapped to IANA with CLDR,
`dungeon/windows_zones.py`) or `TZ` and `/etc/localtime`; the interface then sends the browser's zone
with `user_timezone_source: "detected"`, which is ignored once the user has chosen a zone.
`GET /api/settings` also returns `system_timezone`, the backend's own reading.

## When to call reconcile

Call `POST /api/life/reconcile` when the interface opens and when it becomes visible again after
being hidden. It is cheap when nothing is due and safe to call repeatedly, from several windows or
after a restart: at most one batch runs per return, and a repeated call returns `not_due`. The
server also reconciles once on start and about once a minute while it runs. Those background batches are
rule-built with no model calls unless the user enabled background activity, which adds model wording.

```http
POST /api/life/reconcile
{"mode": "return"}
```

The response always has a `state`, plus the batch (`run`) when one started, resumed or is running:

| `state` | Meaning | Suggested interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `started` | A catch-up batch ran now. `run.results` lists each slot's outcome. | Refresh Today and Feed. |
| `resumed` | An interrupted batch from earlier finished now. | Same as `started`. |
| `in_progress` | Another window or process is running the batch. | Poll `GET /api/life/runs` or reconcile again later. |
| `not_due` | Too little time has passed since the last batch. `due_at` says when one could run. | Nothing. |
| `paused` | Activity is paused. Nothing is simulated while paused. | Show the paused state and Resume. |
| `clock_behind` | The computer's clock is earlier than time already simulated. Nothing is replayed. | Optional notice that the clock moved backward. |
| `disabled` | The user turned catch-up on return off. | Nothing. |
| `no_companion` | No companion exists yet. | Nothing. |

A batch synthesizes fiction *now* for routine slots that ended while the user was away. Its
`created_at` is when it ran; each event's `starts_at`/`ends_at` is when the fictional moment
happened. Never word this as the companion having been active while the app was closed.

### Everyone keeps living

The response describes the companion in focus, but every companion's life moves forward. Each reconcile and
each background tick then takes a turn of the companions out of focus (`LifeEngine.reconcile_cast`), three at a
time in a round that comes back to the start, so a large cast never makes one tick slow and nobody is skipped.
They follow the same settings, catch-up limits and permissions as the one in focus, and their events belong to
their own timeline, so switching to one of them (`POST /api/companion/cast/focus`) shows the day they had on
Today and their Feed. To keep this free, their moments keep the template wording (no model call) and their
posts don't raise desktop notices; only the companion in focus is phrased by the model and notifies. A return
doesn't wait for the cast: their turn runs after the response.

### Preparing while the user types

Call `POST /api/life/prepare` (no body) when the user starts typing or the window sits idle;
debouncing to once every few seconds is plenty. It returns at once with `{"state": "started"}` or
`{"state": "in_progress"}` and never delays anything. In the background it brings the agenda up to
date and, when a model is connected and `phrase_with_model` is on, phrases the companion's next
couple of upcoming agenda entries at background priority. A conversation reply interrupts it. When
one of those slots is later simulated, the batch uses the prepared wording without another model
call (the event's `inputs.prepared` is `true`), provided the model, address and prompt version are
unchanged. A server running with background activity on prepares after each tick as well.

### Batch (`run`) shape

```json
{
  "id": "…", "mode": "return", "status": "completed",
  "window_start": "2026-10-05T12:00:00.000000+00:00", "window_end": "2026-10-06T12:00:00.000000+00:00",
  "plan": [{"key": "morning@2026-10-06", "local_date": "2026-10-06", "starts_at": "…", "ends_at": "…",
            "block": {"key": "morning", "label": "Morning", "kind": "leisure", "days": [0,1,2,3,4,5,6],
                      "start": "09:00", "end": "12:00", "themes": []}}],
  "results": [{"slot": "morning@2026-10-06", "outcome": "proposed", "event_id": "…"}],
  "attempts": 1, "error": null, "created_at": "…", "started_at": "…", "finished_at": "…"
}
```

`status` is `running`, `completed`, `interrupted` (a conversation took priority; the next
reconcile resumes it), or `failed` (shown with `error`). Each result's
`outcome` is:

- `proposed`: an event awaiting the user's review (the user turned automatic events off).
- `committed`: an event that is now part of the companion's life.
- `rejected`: the event was made stale by a pause, character change or permission change (`reason`).
- `quiet`: nothing notable happened (`reason`). Quiet stretches are valid.
- `skipped`: permissions changed or the timeline switched before this slot ran.

`GET /api/life/runs?limit=20` lists recent batches, newest first.

## Reviewing proposed events

Automatic events are on by default (a workspace from before that is switched on once); with them
off, catch-up only proposes. Proposed events appear in
`GET /api/events?history=true` with `status: "proposed"`. Commit or reject them with the existing
`POST /api/events/{id}/commit` and `POST /api/events/{id}/reject`. A commit can still come back
`rejected` with a `rejection` reason when the event became stale. Only committed events reach chat,
the feed and recall.

Life events carry `details` for display: `label` (routine block), `block_kind`, `activity` (the
composed activity, such as `walk` or `groceries`), `place` (`{id, name, kind, city, neighborhood}`
from the world data, or `null`), `local_date`, `timezone`, `post` (a caption in the companion's
voice), `mood` and `weather` (below, or `null`).

### Interests

The character's `interests` and `life_themes` make matching activities about three times as likely
as the others in the same block: "books" leans toward reading, the library and browsing shops,
"jazz" toward shows, "baking" toward cooking at home. Matching is by word, without a model, so a
character with no matching words keeps the even mix.

### Weather

Each day has typical weather for the companion's city, drawn from the world data's monthly climate
averages with a seeded chance of rain: `{season, high_f, low_f, rain, note}`. It is the same for
everyone in the city that day, so the companion and their circle agree. It is not a forecast and
never claims to be real. On a rainy, very hot (93°F and up) or very cold (38°F and below) day,
outdoor activities give way to indoor ones: no walks, and workouts happen at a gym rather than a
park. A rainy day at home sometimes gets a rainy caption. Agenda entries carry it as
`block.weather`, events as `details.weather`, and the chat context includes today's line, marked
as typical for the season and not a real forecast. Cities without climate data, and world sources
without a `weather` method, have no weather and every day is fair.

### City events

The world data lists each city's annual events by month. Each year one Saturday in one of those
months is picked from a seed of the city, event and year, so everyone in the city agrees on the
date; whole seasons (a team's season) are left out. On that day a leisure or social block may be
spent at the event (`activity: "festival"`, `place.kind: "event"`, at most once a day and less
often in bad weather), possibly with a free circle member. Agenda blocks carry the day's events as
`block.happenings` (`[{id, name, neighborhood, city}]`), and the chat context lists them beside the
weather, marked as fictional dates.

### Birthdays

Each circle member has a birthday (`birthday: "MM-DD"` in the circle API), seeded by their id. On
that date one leisure or social block goes to them: the companion celebrates with a local friend
who is free then (`activity: "birthday"`, at a restaurant or bar, `with` naming them), or calls a
relative who lives out of town (no place). The chat context marks the person's birthday on the day, and
lists it with the birthdays and anniversaries from a week ahead (see below).

Events are composed from the routine, a fixed activity catalog and the world data, without a
model. When a model is connected and `phrase_with_model` is on, it only rewrites the wording;
`inputs.wording` is `model` or `template`. Set `home_city` on the character to a city id from the
world data (for example `"baltimore"`) so events use real places there. Without `home_city`, the
character's `location` is used when it names a known city, such as `"Fells Point, Baltimore"`.
When the location also names a neighborhood, everyday places (cafés, restaurants, bars, markets,
libraries, gyms, parks) stay near it; museums, venues and attractions stay city-wide. Circle members
use their own home neighborhood.

### Dungeon plans

Now and then an event also produces a plan for an upcoming leisure or social slot, such as
"Mira is planning to visit the Walters Art Museum on Saturday (afternoon)". A plan is a life event
with `kind: "plan"`, its `starts_at`/`ends_at` set to the target slot, and `details.target_slot`.
It is reviewed and committed like any other event, and the batch result for the event it came
from carries `plan_event_id` and `plan_outcome`. Committed upcoming plans appear in
`GET /api/today` under `plans.companion`. A plan is not an outing: when its slot is simulated, the
batch always includes that slot and writes the outing "as planned", with `details.fulfils` set to
the plan's id. If the slot falls outside a later batch's lookback, the plan quietly lapses.

### Unresolved threads

Now and then a simulated slot also opens a small open question in the companion's life, such as
"Mira ordered a secondhand record player and is waiting for it to arrive". A thread is a life event
with `kind: "thread"` and `details.state: "open"`, a stable `details.thread_key` and
`details.settles_on`, the local date from which it may settle. Once it is committed, the first
simulated slot on or after that date writes how it turned out: another `kind: "thread"` event with
`details.state: "settled"` and the same `thread_key`. Both are reviewed like any event, at most one
thread is open at a time, a kind of thread is not opened again within 120 days, and the batch result for the slot carries `thread_event_id` and
`thread_outcome`. `GET /api/today` lists committed open threads whose outcome is not committed yet
under `plans.threads`.

## Social circle

The companion has a small circle of supporting people (PRD T8). Each is assembled from the city
data and a seed, without a model. In a known city this uses the world data's circle generator: a
name from the city's name groups, how they know the companion, an age, a home near the
companion's neighborhood when their location names one, a job with its weekly routine and a few
regular haunts. Relatives may live out of town, with no routine here. Elsewhere a simpler version
picks a first name, a role and a career's routine. The circle is created the first time it is needed. Its members are fictional
supporting characters, never the user and never a source of facts about the user.

```http
GET   /api/life/circle                     # ?include_removed=true also lists removed people
PATCH /api/life/circle/{id}                {"name": "Rowan"}
POST  /api/life/circle/{id}/remove
POST  /api/life/circle/{id}/restore
POST  /api/life/circle/{id}/spared         {"spared": false}   # People can pass away: whether they can
POST  /api/life/circle/{id}/bring-back     # someone who passed away comes back, as if it never happened
GET   /api/life/circle/{id}/diary          # ?before=<starts_at>&limit=20, newest first
```

Loss and grief (dungeon/life/loss.py): with `people_pass_away` on in the life settings (off on every preset),
the consequence engine's `loss:passes` decides once a year whether an adult in the circle passes away, by age and the
`loss` slider (0 rare to 3 often), with a decision of its own for a parent in treatment or whose care went harder.
Never a companion, a child, the companion's partner, or someone the character's description names unless `spared` is
false. Someone who passed away stays on the list with `late` (the date) and `loss` (`{id, died_on, consequence_id}`),
whatever `include_removed` says; restore or bring-back undoes the death, calls off the funeral (a big day of kind
`funeral`) and changes the outcome to living on.

A person is `{id, name, role, status, revision, career, employer, neighborhood, city, refs, sources,
data_version, birthday, schedule, now, recent}`, plus `full_name`, `pronouns`, `age`, `local`, `closeness` and
`haunts` when they came from a known city. `name` is the given name used in events; `local: false`
means they live out of town and have an empty `schedule`. `now` is the routine block they are in right now (for example
`{"label": "Registered nurse", "kind": "work", ...}`) or `null`. `recent` is the newest three diary
entries. A diary entry is `{subject, slot, starts_at, ends_at, local_date, block, entry, status}`,
where `entry` holds `summary`, `activity`, `place`, `mood` and `post`. Diary entries also carry `with_companion`
(`{event_id, summary}` or `null`): a committed companion event this person was part of. One that no
diary entry overlaps appears as its own entry with `slot` and `block` set to `null`. People favour
their regular haunts when one fits. Renaming, removing or
restoring someone rebuilds their upcoming entries and the companion's upcoming entries that name
them. Entries that already happened keep the earlier name. Social events can name a circle member
who is free at the time: the event's `details.with` is `{id, name}` or `null`. The chat context
lists the circle with each person's current block and latest diary entry.

### Circle size and who knows whom

How many people the circle has depends on the companion. Words in their identity, personality,
interests and themes decide how sociable they are (`social butterfly`, `outgoing`, `extroverted`
against `shy`, `introvert`, `homebody`; a negated word such as "not shy" doesn't count): 4 people
for a quiet one, 5 usually and 10 for a sociable one. The Life setting `circle_size` (0 to 12, 0 = decide
from the character) overrides it. A sociable circle fills in as close friend, longtime friend, coworker,
sibling, parent, new friend, a second coworker, friend, the other parent, a second new friend, cousin
and friend. Parents and siblings are named as the companion would say it (`mom`, `dad`, `sister`,
`brother`) when their pronouns say which. A coworker in a sociable circle works where the companion
works: their `schedule` has the companion's work blocks, `career` reads "Works with {name}" and
`works_with_companion` is `true`. A companion with no work block has friends instead of coworkers.

```http
GET  /api/life/circle/room     # {people, target, sociability}
POST /api/life/circle/grow     # adds people up to the target; 409 when the circle is already full
```

A circle assembled smaller than its target (an existing companion, or a size raised in Settings)
grows with `grow`: missing roles first, nobody already there changes. Each person also has `knows`:
the other active members they know (`{id, name, how}`), derived from roles and a seed, so it is the
same on every read. `how` is `family`, `married` or `divorced` (the two parents), `coworkers`, `old
friends`, `known for years` (an old friend and the family) or `friends`. The chat context adds it to
each person's line ("Married to Rui. Knows Ana (family).").
## Home and belongings

`dungeon/life/home.py` gives the companion a home and things they live with, assembled once per
timeline without a model: the home the budget (`money.py`) pays rent on, same neighbourhood, size and rent
(else one from `generators.home`), plus the kind of building and its quirks; maybe a
pet, a few plants, a way to get around (a car is less likely in a city with a subway; earlier eras
ride or cycle) and a few favourite things weighted toward their interests. Every two weeks a seeded
draw may change one thing on one day: a new plant, a plant lost, the car into the shop for a few
days, a new favourite thing, a vet visit, an adopted pet, rearranged furniture. Evolving in steps or
all at once gives the same log.

- **Events.** `agenda.extend_subject` calls `home.touch` once per companion entry (the only hook in
  the life sim). It appends one plain sentence to the summary: the day's change, or now and then a
  belonging that fits the activity (the dog on a walk, watering a plant while cooking, riding the
  bike to the shops). `entry.home` records `{items, change, sentence}`. Circle entries are untouched.
- **Images.** `images/prompts.build` adds `home.image_hint`: the room for a moment at home, and how a
  belonging named in the event looks.
- **Chat.** The context has a "Your home and belongings" section with today's inventory, any repair
  under way and the last three weeks of changes.
- **Money.** `home.monthly_costs(connection, timeline_id, day)` returns `{rent, rent_period, currency,
  estimate, pets, vehicles}`; `home.purchases(connection, timeline_id, start, end)` returns the
  changes that cost something (`spend` is `$` or `$$`). Read these rather than the tables.

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/life/home?include_removed=` | | `{today, items, removed, changes, costs, varieties}` |
| POST | `/api/life/home/items` | `{kind, name, description?, variety?}` | the same view |
| PATCH | `/api/life/home/items/{id}` | `{name?, description?, variety?}` | the same view |
| POST | `/api/life/home/items/{id}/remove` / `restore` | | the same view |

### Pastimes

`dungeon/life/hobbies.py` gives each companion up to three pastimes, without a model. Written
interests that name one (`match`, by its words and era) come first; the app picks the rest from
`dungeon/world/data/hobbies/catalogue.json` to fit their era and city (a climbing gym, a lake).
Each has a seeded skill (0 to 100) and talent; every session adds to it, less as it grows, and it
slips after a month without practice. Passing a seeded threshold logs a milestone from the kind's
bank (`<kind>.json`, 100+ era-tagged lines at five levels), which becomes a feed post and a picture.

- **Days.** `agenda` calls `hobbies.touch` per companion entry: sessions take the first free slot
  that fits the pastime's time of day (`entry.hobby`, activity `hobby`). The walk is written once to
  `hobby_log`, with a Monday `mark` of the state, so a rewind (slider change, user edit, fork) walks
  again the same way.
- **Months.** Once a month, on a seeded day, a pastime may stall, pick back up, or (app-added, not kept,
  after a dry spell of eight weeks) be given up; with room, a new one may start. The odds come from
  `life_settings.hobbies_realism` (0 off to 3 dramatic). Written interests and the user's own are
  never given up on their own.
- **Money.** Gear on taking one up and monthly fees go through `hobbies.purchases` into
  `money.household`.
- **Chat.** The "Your pastimes" section lists each one (how long, how good in words, how often) and
  the last three weeks of milestones. First texts: `hobby_news` shares a milestone from today, and
  `hobby_invite` asks the user along a few days off, which saves an outing (`activity: hobby`).
  When the user asks to go do one together, `outings.proposal` names it before other activities.

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/life/hobbies` | | `{today, hobbies, level_names, realism, can_add}` (`numbers` per pastime with Hidden values on) |
| POST | `/api/life/hobbies` | `{name, level?}` | the same view |
| PATCH | `/api/life/hobbies/{id}` | `{level?, kept?, status?: active \| dropped}` | the same view |

### Wardrobe

`dungeon/life/wardrobe.py` (piece catalogue in `dungeon/life/clothing.py`) assembles the
companion's clothes once per timeline, without a model. The budget's pay tier and spending style
(money.py) set how many pieces they own (about 22 for the lowest tier, 58 for the highest, more for
spenders and people whose personality or interests talk about fashion, fewer for minimalists) and
how fine they are (thrifted at the bottom, designer at the top). Their career sets a dress code and
the work kit that comes with it (scrubs, chef whites, an all-black server outfit, a suit, a lab
coat, or their own clothes). Words in their personality, identity, interests and appearance pick
one to three styles (classic, sporty, bohemian, edgy, cozy, preppy, vintage, minimal) and their
colours; pronouns decide whether dresses and skirts are in the mix. Clothing their appearance
names ("her battered leather jacket") becomes a favourite worn often. The city's era decides what
exists and its climate how many coats they need.

- **Outfits** are drawn, never stored: `outfit(items, occasion, seed, weather, code)` picks what they
  wear for work, casual, going out, at home, working out or in bed, from the moment's activity and
  block kind (`occasion_for`), adding a coat when the day is cold or rainy and they are outside. The
  same timeline, date, occasion and weather always give the same outfit.
- **Change.** Every two weeks a seeded draw (likelier for spenders, the well-paid and fashion lovers)
  may buy a piece (leaning to coats in autumn and light things in spring; when money is tight that
  day they only eye it), wear one out, clear out two, or mend one. Purchases go in `wardrobe_log`
  with a `spend` tier; `wardrobe.purchases` feeds them to `money.household`, so they count as
  spending this pay period ("you spent money on clothes").
- **Events.** `agenda.extend_subject` calls `wardrobe.touch` after `home.touch`; on the day of a
  change it appends one sentence ("Kim bought a mustard raincoat.") to a non-work entry, once.
  `entry.wardrobe` records `{change, sentence}`. Tests turn this off (`wardrobe.WEAVE`).
- **Images.** Feed pictures (`images/prompts.setting`) and chat moments and selfies
  (`build_moment`, not views) add `wardrobe.image_hint`: "Wearing a camel peacoat over …". When they
  do, `prompts.without_clothes` drops the clothing clauses from the appearance description (glasses
  and accessories stay), so the picture doesn't mix their usual outfit with the moment's.
- **Chat.** The context has a "Your clothes" section: their style and size, favourites, what they
  have on right now, each category's pieces and the last three weeks of changes.

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/life/wardrobe?include_removed=` | | `{today, items, removed, changes, wearing, profile, categories, labels}` |
| POST | `/api/life/wardrobe/items` | `{category, name, description?, favorite?}` | the same view |
| PATCH | `/api/life/wardrobe/items/{id}` | `{name?, description?, category?, favorite?}` | the same view |
| POST | `/api/life/wardrobe/items/{id}/remove` / `restore` | | the same view |

An item is `{id, kind, name, variety, description, origin: generated|change|user, since, until,
edited, revision, out_of_action}`; the home also has `neighborhood, city, features, rent,
rent_range, currency, rent_period, estimate`. `variety` is a pet's species or a vehicle's type
(`varieties` lists the choices). The home itself can be edited but not removed. Any edit forgets
the seeded changes still ahead and rebuilds the upcoming agenda entries that mention the home;
moments that already happened keep what they said. A fork keeps the home as it was at the fork.

## Friends of friends

Everyone in the circle has their own people, and theirs have theirs, down to four layers from the
companion (`dungeon/life/network.py`). Nobody out there is stored or simulated: a person is a seeded
path from a circle member (`circle:<timeline>:<n>/2/0`) rebuilt the same way on request, with an
era-fitting name (`dungeon/world/naming.py`) and only relatives sharing a family name. A partner gets no
partner of their own. Nobody unrelated to the companion carries the companion's family name or a relative's
(the city's `kin`, see world-data.md); townsfolk and newcomers follow the same rule.

```http
GET /api/life/network?key=<key>   # {person, people: [{key, full, relation, how, age, occupation, met}], deeper}
GET /api/life/acquaintances       # people met through the circle, newest first
```

A circle member's `key` is on `GET /api/life/circle`; each person returned carries the key for the next
layer while `deeper` is true.

They come up at gatherings and run-ins. When the agenda writes a Friday or Saturday evening the companion
has free, a free friend (not family) may host something: a Friendsgiving in November, a summer barbecue, a
holiday party in December, game night, a dinner party, a housewarming. The companion goes, the entry names
two to four of the host's people they met, sometimes one of a guest's people too, and each is saved as an
acquaintance with a snapshot of who they are. An acquaintance counts once that evening has happened and its
entry still records the meeting. Later, out somewhere, the companion now and then runs into one of them
("Ran into Jordan Lee (Becca's coworker, from Becca's Friendsgiving) there."). The chat context lists the
six most recent acquaintances and where they met; forks keep those met before the fork. No model is
involved.

## Townsfolk around the city

Every place in the city has two or three seeded background people (`dungeon/world/townsfolk.py`): staff
(the barista, the barkeep, the librarian) and regulars, each with an era-fitting name and job, a home
neighborhood near the place, a temperament, a quirk, a flaw, a desire and a list of goals. They are never
stored; `town:<city>:<place>:<n>` rebuilds one. Plain if/then/else rules (`whereabouts`) put them somewhere
at any hour: on shift, asleep, on their usual visit, off working toward their goal (a run in the park, study
at the library), out at a bar on a weekend evening when they want company, or at home. Their goal moves
week by week from 5 January 2026 (`story`): a seeded roll each week makes progress, stalls or is a setback,
a driven temperament helps and a procrastinating or spendthrift flaw drags, and once enough progress is made
they reach it and start the next goal.

Every neighborhood also has 40 to 80 ordinary residents (`residents`, keys `town:<city>:~<neighborhood>:<n>`),
about 1,250 in Baltimore on top of the 330 at its places. Their rules: asleep; waiting at their neighborhood's
transit stop before work (leaving when their career's schedule says: early, office or evening hours); at work;
walking home; their usual spot nearby; their goal's spot; a bar on weekend evenings when they want company;
the weekly shop; out front on some evenings; else home. Each resident only ever goes to the few places in their
`reach`, so `reaching(place)` checks the residents of the surrounding neighborhoods without building the whole
city. None of this runs on a timer: asking where someone is at any moment gives the same answer a running
simulation would, and costs nothing for the people nobody asks about.

When the agenda sends the companion somewhere real for leisure, an errand or a social plan, someone there by
their rules may cross paths with them (`dungeon/life/encounters.py`; at most one a day). The first time is
a chat with a stranger; the second reveals what they are working toward; from the third the companion knows
their flaw and what they seem to want, and later meetings bring their news. People already met can turn up
wherever their rules take them. A meeting counts once its slot has happened and the entry still records it
(`entry.townsfolk = {key, times}`), and forks keep meetings before the fork. The chat context lists the six
most recently seen, with only what the companion has learned. No model is involved.

Each townsperson also has a life so far (`dungeon/world/life_details.py`, bank in
`dungeon/world/data/life_details.json`): where they come from, their work history (years at the job they have
now, or retirement, and one or two jobs before it from the city's careers for the era), a family detail or two
fitted to their age, maybe a named pet, two tastes and four stories from their past. People at one place or on one
street never tell the same story. The companion learns where they are from at the first meeting, their work and a
taste at the second, family and pets at the third, then one story per meeting, which the diary line mentions.
These reach the chat context, Around town (`facts`, `stories`), Story mode's people and the profile drafted when
a townsperson becomes the main character. The bank grows without code changes; `tests/test_life_details.py`
checks its rules (subject-less lowercase clauses, no final period, no gendered words, a `period` alternative where
wording is modern). Goals and quirks are data too (`world/data/goals.json`, `world/data/quirks.json`, each with the
line a dating profile shows), as are the temperaments, flaws and desires in `perception.json` (their `town` part).

```http
GET /api/life/townsfolk                     # townsfolk met, most recently seen first, only what is known
GET /api/life/townsfolk/person?key=<key>    # one of them, plus `now`: where their rules put them right now

GET /api/world/cities/<id>/neighborhoods/<hood>/people?on=<date>&at=<HH:MM>   # a neighborhood's residents
```

### The city map

Today > Map, Story mode's Map button and the "Show on map" links on Today open the companion's city
(`dungeon/life/citymap.py`). Every place in the city pack is a pin, placed near its neighbourhood's centre
(packs have no per-place coordinates, so the card says "Location approximate"). Their home, their usual
places (two or more visits in 60 days), places from the last two weeks and Story mode's scene are marked;
companions have no set workplace yet, so nothing is marked as work. A place's card shows its spots, the last
three things that happened there with them, the townsfolk they know who are regulars there, and "Go there"
(Story mode on, moves the scene) or "Suggest going together" (puts a line in their composer, never sends it).
Real public cities of today use OpenStreetMap tiles in the interface, which needs internet; past-era, fictional, original and
private cities, or a street map that fails to load, get a drawn map in the same colours: each neighbourhood a
district shaped by its neighbours, with side streets, main roads to the districts it borders, parks, and any
sea, rivers and lakes the city file names (`water`), labelled not to scale. The map never shows where the user is. No model is involved.

```http
GET /api/life/map    # {city: {id, name, lat, lon, real}, hoods: [{id, name, lat, lon, next}], places: [...], water: [...], story}
```

### Who knows who

Today > Who knows who draws everyone the user has met or heard about as a web (`dungeon/life/web.py`):
the companions and their ties to each other, each companion's circle and how its members know each other,
people met through them, townsfolk met around town (staff at the same place are coworkers), the people the
user told a companion about, Matchlight matches and, with Story mode on, people met in the story. It is read
from what the app already keeps, with no model and nothing stored; secrets, closeness and moods stay out.
Dragged bubbles keep their place in this browser.

```http
GET /api/life/web    # {nodes: [{id, name, kind, detail, hood, companion_id?, main?}], links: [{source, target, label, kind}]}
```

### Shared or seeded townsfolk

A city's townsfolk are the same for every companion living in it, so the shipped cities come with their own
people. The user can seed new townsfolk for their companion in Character > Townsfolk: the companion gets a
`town_seed`, mixed into every person's seed (`townsfolk.seed_for`), so the same places and neighborhoods hold
different people. Seeding again draws another town; clearing it goes back to the shared one. Either way the
companion's meetings are forgotten, since they name people who are no longer there. Companions who switched
(below) share one town, so this is only offered with one companion in the workspace.

```
POST /api/companion/town {fresh: true}    # new townsfolk of their own; {fresh: false} for the shared ones
```

### Switching the main character

The user can make any townsperson the companion has met the main character (`dungeon/cast.py`). Their
profile is drafted from their sheet with no model (job and shift as the weekly routine, temperament, quirk,
flaw, desire, goal, and the meetings with the companion), or written out by the text model from the same
sheet, and the user reviews it before switching. The new main character gets their own companion record,
character versions and timeline; the one who steps back keeps all of theirs, with no slot
(`companions.slot` is 1 only for the main character, `stepped_back_at` says when they left it).

Companions who stepped back live in the same city under the key `cast:<companion id>`: their old sheet if they
came from town (under their current name), else a resident's sheet in their own neighborhood. Meetings count
both ways, so the new main character already knows the companion they met, and the townsperson who took over
never appears in town.

Small world: since every companion lives their own days (Everyone keeps living), another companion is where
their own agenda puts them, not where the townsfolk rules would. Two companions whose evenings take them to
the same bar or gym can run into each other there, and another companion there is talked to before strangers
half the time (`encounters.FELLOW_CHANCE`). Whoever plans that day second sees the other there; a day the
other's agenda doesn't reach yet finds them nowhere, and only a companion who has never lived a day is still
placed by the townsfolk rules. The meeting goes in both diaries when the other's slot is still to come and
holds no meeting of its own (`encounters.mirror`), and a day counts once however many diaries tell it. Their
closeness with each other follows from these meetings (see Group chat, two-way closeness). The first meeting
is news: each of them may text the user about it (`crossed_paths` in First messages), with the usual holds. Start over and delete then touch only the main
character's rows (`dungeon/start_over.py`); deleting brings back whoever stepped back most recently. They
still text first and keep their chats (see First messages and Chats and unread messages).

```
GET  /api/companion/cast                  # every companion: {id, name, main, from_town, stepped_back_at}
GET  /api/companion/cast/draft?key=<key>  # {definition, person, stepping_back}; 404 unless they have met
POST /api/companion/cast/draft {key}      # the same, written out by the text model
POST /api/companion/cast/switch {key, definition}
POST /api/companion/cast/focus {companion_id}   # switch back
```

### The town paper

Every Sunday the companion's city has a short local paper (`dungeon/world/paper.py`), shown on Today: "The
Baltimore Weekly", or a gazette for a period or fantasy city. It is written only from what the world already
holds, with no model call, so an issue reads the same every time it is opened:

- city news: changes announced, starting or ending that week (see `dungeon/world/changes.py`);
- townsfolk who reached a goal that week, from the first residents of each neighborhood;
- "Seen around town": one public outing that week per companion in the city (a show, a game, a museum);
- "Overheard": companions who crossed paths that week (Small world), with no names, and never at an outing
  "Seen around town" names;
- "Coming up": the next week's annual events and holidays, and the typical weather.

Nothing private goes in: no storylines, circle, chats or secrets, and companions appear only where anyone
could have seen them.

```
GET /api/life/paper[?day=YYYY-MM-DD]   # the issue out on or before day (this week's when left out):
                                        # {title, city, date, news, townsfolk, seen, gossip,
                                        #  ahead: {events, holidays, weather}, previous, next (null on this week's)}
```

## Precomputed agenda

Every reconcile also brings a hidden agenda up to date, without a model (PRD T9). The agenda holds
the routine of the companion and of each circle member, composed slot by slot a week ahead and
seeded by the slot. When the app opens after time away, the whole gap is filled in at once, up to
30 days back. A server left running advances the same agenda in small steps, and both reach the same
entries. Upcoming entries are never returned by the API. Circle members' past entries are their
diary. The companion's past entries become part of their account only through the capped,
reviewed events above: a batch uses the precomputed entry for each slot it simulates, and a plan
reveals an upcoming entry. Changing the character rebuilds the companion's upcoming entries. The chat context lists the companion's next few
upcoming entries within a day as likely intentions, so "what are you doing tonight?" gets an answer
that matches what later happens; the companion is told they have not happened and may change, and
mentioning them commits nothing. The Time section also lays out the companion's own day from the same
entries (today's blocks with their times, what they are in right now, "no work or classes today" and
the next shift or class), and the recent events are dated in the companion's own time, so a reply does
not claim a shift on a day off. On a public holiday in the city's
calendar, a work or study block becomes a day off: the entry's block has `kind: "leisure"`, a label
such as "Thanksgiving (day off)" and `holiday`, and events simulated from it carry that block. Slots
inside a pause are marked skipped.

Each day also carries how its subject feels physically (`dungeon/life/body.py`), worked out from
the day before with no model and seeded by the subject and date: a late night out can leave them
`tired` or `hungover`, a hectic shift `worn out`, a workout `sore`, and now and then a cold
(`sick`, more often in winter) lasts two or three days. Every block that day gets
`body: {state, because}`. A cold turns work or study into a sick day and leisure into "Home sick"
(`kind: "rest"`, `sick_day: true`), and a sick circle member is not free for plans. A low day keeps
leisure and social time to calm activities at home or nearby. Events carry `details.body`, Today's
`day.body` shows it and the chat context gets one line about it. Background reconciles extend the agenda only when background
activity is on.

### Plans made in chat

When a completed companion message (a reply or a first message) states a plan of their own for one
resolvable day, `dungeon/life/own_plans.py` pins it with no model: "my bout is Saturday the 24th,
first whistle at 6", "I'm hosting a potluck at my place on Thanksgiving", "I'm going to my grandma's
Sunday", "Christmas is just going to be me and Juniper on the couch". The day can be a weekday,
"the 24th" (which must agree with a weekday given with it), a month and day, "tonight" or "tomorrow",
or a holiday in the city's calendar (the US one when the city is unknown); a time is kept when given
(a bare hour from 1 to 11 is read as pm unless the sentence says morning). Questions, maybes,
conditionals, negations, past tense, vague days ("this weekend") and plans about the user or "we"
are skipped. A plan belongs to its message the way a self fact does: it applies on every timeline
holding that message or a copy, and goes when the reply is replaced or deleted.

On that date the agenda gives the plan the companion's free block that holds its time, or with no
time the free block around 7 pm (else the day's last free one), and the day's other free blocks stay
quiet. Work, study and sleep are never overridden: a plan during a shift stays noted but places
nowhere, though a public holiday's day off counts as free. The entry has activity `own-plan` and
`entry.own_plan: {id, message_id, statement, at}`; every companion block on a date with plans lists
their ids in `block.plans`, so upcoming entries are rebuilt whenever the plans in force for their date
change. Return batches simulate these slots first, and the event carries `details.own_plan`. The chat
context lists upcoming plans under "Plans you have made in chat".

### Recommendations

When the user writes "you should watch / read / listen to / play / try / visit / go to / check out X"
(not as a question or hypothetical), `dungeon/life/recommendations.py` records X with a kind
(`show`, `movie`, `book`, `music`, `game` or `outing`) and a seeded number of sessions. From 12 hours
later, the companion's free leisure, social or rest slots get one session a day (activity
`recommendation`, `entry.recommendation: {id, title, kind, session, of, verdict}`), and the last one
carries a verdict, seeded and tipped warmer by matching interests or stated likes. Return batches
simulate these slots before others, so they become committed events. The chat context lists each
recommendation's committed progress and tells the companion it knows nothing about it beyond its
name. A finished one can open a conversation. `GET /api/life/recommendations` lists them as
`{id, kind, title, state: waiting|started|finished, sessions_done, verdict}`, and
`POST /api/life/recommendations/{id}/drop` takes one back, clearing its upcoming sessions.

### Storylines

Things unfold over days in the companion's life and their circle's (`dungeon/life/storylines.py`):
"my dad just got a promotion", "the new guy at work keeps hitting on me", "I got drunk and kissed my
best friend". Each is a fixed template with a cast from the circle (or the companion's own work) and
one to three beats a few days apart. Whether one starts on a day, which template and who is in it
are decided by a seed when it starts, never by a model; a beat that can turn out more than one way is
left to the consequence engine on its day (below). Later beats stay hidden until their local date. The Life setting `drama` (0 quiet, 1 realistic, 2 dramatic, 3 soap
opera; default 1) sets how often one starts (about 4%, 8%, 15% or 28% of days), how many run at once
(1 to 4) and which templates can happen: quiet keeps to good news; realistic adds everyday trouble
(a creepy new coworker, a friend's breakup, layoff rumors); dramatic adds health scares, feuds and
secret romances; soap opera adds drunk kisses, separations and family secrets. A template doesn't
repeat within 90 days, a person is in one running storyline at a time, and a companion in a romance
with the user never gets one about their own love life.

```http
GET  /api/life/storylines                 # ?include_ended=true also lists ended ones
POST /api/life/storylines/{id}/end        # it leaves Today and the context; later beats never happen
```

A storyline is `{id, story, level, started_on, status, cast: [{id, name, role}], beats: [{on, text,
share, tone, consequence}], unfolding}`, listing only beats whose date has come. Names are filled in as people are
named now; removing someone ends the storylines they are in. The chat context lists the last three
weeks' storylines and says when one is still unfolding, so the companion never guesses the ending.
There the beats are told to the companion as "you" ("You got the promotion", "Cathy, your mom, got a
promotion at work"), rewritten from each template, so the companion never hands its own news back to
the user; Today keeps the third person. A settled storyline stays in the context by its outcome for
60 days after its last beat; after that it joins memory search, so asking about it months later can
still bring the outcome back (embedded like memories when semantic recall is on).
A beat from today or yesterday can open a conversation, using its `share` line when no model is
connected. Days are decided as the agenda extends, up to 14 days back after time away.

#### The consequence engine

Whether two feuding friends make up, whether the companion gets the promotion: a beat with more than
one way to go is decided on its day by `dungeon/consequences.py`, not by a coin flipped when the
storyline started. The engine reads the state that bears on it (the drama level, how close the
companion is to each person in the story, how the two of them know each other, the first person's age,
and words in the companion's own description such as "driven" or "stubborn", skipping "not shy"),
turns it into odds from a small table per turning (`world/data/consequences.json`), rolls seeded dice
and records the outcome in `consequences` with every option's odds and the reasons that moved them.
The same world and seed always give the same result. The model never sees odds or reasons: the
companion only hears what happened. A fork keeps outcomes decided by its point and decides later ones
itself.

```http
GET  /api/life/consequences/{id}          # {id, label, decided_on, options: [{option, label, odds, reasons}], picked, picked_by}
POST /api/life/consequences/{id}/change   # {"option": 1}: make it go that way instead (picked_by becomes "user")
```

A decided beat carries its outcome's id as `consequence`. Today shows it under "Why it went this way"
with each way it could have gone, its odds and reasons, and a button to make it go another way.

An outcome can leave **marks** for a while (the option's `marks` in the table, stored in `marks`):
`mood` or `money` with an amount, which add up per person and are read back as the `mood` and `money`
readers (a companion low after a missed promotion is likelier to stay cold after a fight), or `avoid`,
which keeps the companion away from someone (they are left out of company, drop-ins and gatherings). Marks
also tilt the day (`disruptions.tilts`): low spirits make a quiet night in likelier, tight money makes plans
fall through and things come up more often, and the chat context's money section says money has felt
tight (or easier) lately. A mark with `ripple` also reaches each companion who feels Close or closer to the
companion (backstories, groups and Small world meetings), as a lighter mood mark on their own timeline.
Changing how it went redoes the marks from that day. The note lists what an outcome left and whom it reached
(`marks: [{kind, amount, note, until, ripple, holder, who}]` in the outcome).

#### What the user does

`dungeon/life/reactions.py` puts four things the user does through the engine, only ones the app can tell
happened without guessing: telling someone a secret in a group chat that was kept from them (each companion who
held it from the start reacts), an agreed plan with a sure date passing with no message from the user that day,
chatting on the companion's birthday or a first-talk anniversary without mentioning it, and adding someone to a
group with "show everything" (members who had spoken there react). Each is a `user:*` choice: whether it stings
comes only from an emotional trait the user built into the character whose name speaks to it (`minds`, 0 to 3
from its intensity; without one the companion lets it go, about 33%, 50% or 60% for mild, moderate or strong).
A sting leaves a mood mark for a few days whose `told` line goes into the chat context's "How you are taking
something the user did lately" section, so the companion can bring it up once in their own words; it never
cools closeness. Today lists these under "How {name} took things lately" with the same "Why it went this way"
note and button.

```http
GET /api/life/reactions                   # the last 30 days, newest first, as outcomes
```

Out of character, "what if?" questions get the engine's odds without rolling anything: an OOC message's
note lists the turnings still to come in running storylines with their odds as things stand, and the odds for
the user's own choices the app would notice (telling someone a secret this companion holds, a plan or occasion
in the next week). The model answers from them in plain words; the companion never sees them in character.

Secrets use the engine too: whether a gossip would pass a secret on to someone in a group chat is the
choice `secret:pass_on`, from how close they feel (about 86% at Close or closer, 20% a step below, never
to someone they hardly know), seeded by the secret, the two of them and that closeness. Only a companion
with the gossip flaw passes anything on, and never to someone it is kept from.

#### Life chapters

`dungeon/life/chapters.py` gives the companion a lasting change every few months, picked by the engine. Once
a month, on a day seeded by the timeline, a chapter may begin: about 12%, 20%, 30% or 40% a month from the
quiet to the soap-opera drama level, never within 45 days of the timeline starting or 75 days of the last one.
The choice `chapter:next` picks which, from the marks earlier outcomes left (tight money makes a new job likelier,
money coming in makes a move likelier), the companion's own description (driven, restless, a homebody) and what
is possible at all (`can_<kind>`):

- `new_job`: another career the city offers on the same kind of schedule, paying the same or more (more when
  money has been tight); the budget follows.
- `move`: another neighbourhood of the city whose rents fit their pay; the old home ends and a new one starts.
- `pet`: a pet comes home, when they have none.
- `hobby`: a pastime they take up for real joins their interests.
- `friend_moves`: a friend in the circle who isn't in a running storyline moves to another city and leaves
  the circle.

A career, location or interest is an overlay on the character for that timeline (`characters.with_chapters`),
so everything reading their life sees how it is now while the saved character stays as written; a fork made
before the chapter keeps the old life. A chapter never touches personality, emotional traits or a romance
companion's love life. The chat context's storylines section tells the companion for 90 days ("This is how your
life is now"), and a chapter from today or yesterday can open a conversation. Today lists them under "New
chapters in {name}'s life" with "Why it went this way"; "Make it go this way" swaps in another chapter that
is possible from the same day, and Undo takes it back (a new home or pet goes and the old home returns, a
friend who moved comes back; what happened meanwhile stays).

```http
GET  /api/life/chapters                   # the chapters in place, newest first
POST /api/life/chapters/{id}/undo         # take one back; returns the rest
```

#### News travels

`dungeon/news.py` lets word of a companion's news get around. News is a storyline beat that turned out good or
bad (never a storyline that is a secret) or a new life chapter, from the last 14 days. It starts with the companion
it happened to and spreads each evening (from 20:00 their time) for five days, one hop a day: whoever had heard by
the start of a day may pass it on that evening. A companion can tell the people in their circle and the other
companions they know (memory/pairs.py, `known_companions`); a circle person can tell their companion and the rest
of that circle. Whether a teller passes it on is the consequence engine's choice `news:pass_on`: likelier the
closer they feel (never at "Just met"), when it is their own news, and from a gossip; the dice are seeded by the
news, the pair and the day. It runs in the life engine every ten minutes, rules only, whatever background activity
says, and never while paused. A chapter's news follows its title and ends when the chapter is undone.

`news_holders` records who heard it, on which day, how (`origin`, `word`, `group`) and from whom (`told_by`).
A companion who heard news about someone else gets it in their chat context under "News you heard about people
you know" for 14 days ("Heard on 2026-10-07 (Ana (Kimberly's sister) told you): …"), and news about another
companion heard today or yesterday can open a conversation ("Did you hear about Kimberly??"), sometimes before
that companion has told the user. Only life events travel, never anything from the user's chats, and the prompt
says they don't know whether the user has heard, so no companion seems to have read the user's other chats.
Group chats: see docs/group-chat.md. Today shows "Word getting around": the companion's recent news and who has
heard it, from whom, once anyone has, only with Settings > Realism > Hidden values > "Show who has heard their news"
on (workspace `show_news`, off by default; `GET /api/life/news` returns `[]` while it is off). Word travels either
way.

```http
GET  /api/life/news                       # the companion's recent news and who heard it: [{id, text, happened_on, heard}]; [] while hidden
```

### Birthdays and anniversaries

`dungeon/life/occasions.py` keeps four kinds of day, from the calendar and saved state only:

- The companion's birthday: the definition's `birthday` (`"MM-DD"`), or a date seeded by the
  companion's id when it is empty. On the day, their first free leisure or social slot from noon is a
  celebration (`activity: "own-birthday"`), with a free circle member when there is one.
- The user's birthday: the Life setting `user_birthday` (`"MM-DD"` or empty). It is filled in the first
  time the user says it plainly ("my birthday is March 3rd", "it's my birthday today"; questions and
  "if…" are skipped) and is never replaced by a later message; the user changes or clears it in
  Settings.
- An active circle member's birthday (seeded by their id, in the companion's timezone): "Today is your mom
  Cathy's birthday." It is the companion's news, so it carries no hint to wish anyone and never opens a
  conversation.
- How long they have talked, counted from the timeline's first message in the user's timezone: a
  month, 100 days, three months, six months, then every year. For a romance it reads as their
  anniversary.

The chat context lists the day itself and birthdays within a week. Today's response has `occasions`
(`[{key, kind, date, days, span, text, template}]`, `kind` one of `user_birthday`, `own_birthday`,
`circle_birthday`, `anniversary`; a `circle_birthday` adds `person` and `relation`). On the day, an occasion
other than a circle birthday is the first reason the companion may message first.

### Everyone gets older

`dungeon/life/ages.py` gives each person one stored birth date (`birth_dates`), worked out once from the age
they had when it was first needed and their birthday, so nobody's age jumps on an upgrade; from then on their
age goes up on each birthday. Rules only, no model.

- A companion starts from their looks sheet's age (the Looks age set on the form, else the age their identity
  gives, else seeded). When the user writes another age or birthday, the date is worked out again, so the form
  always wins. The definition's `keeps_age` ("Keeps their age" under Looks on the Character page, off by default)
  holds them at the age they are when it goes on (`held_age`); turned off, they carry on from there. A sheet that reads as under 18 never gets a date.
- Their Looks line and pictures use the age on that day. Once a birthday takes them past the age their words
  give, their own prompt adds one line after Looks: "You are 35 now; you turned 35 on 3 March." (A/B
  2026-10-18: without it most models answered with the age written.) Their written words stay as they are.
- Circle members and love-life partners age in their stored rows (`details.age`), which `ages.sync` keeps
  current a few times an hour alongside the news, so everything that reads them sees the age now.
- Townsfolk stay stateless: their seeded age is their age on the day the town started getting older, plus a
  year on each seeded birthday since (`ages.town_age`). Around town shows it.
- Milestone birthdays (30, 40, 50 ...) are bigger: the occasion reads "your 40th birthday, a big one" and
  carries `turns`, Today says "It is Dana's 40th birthday today.", the first text is "Guess who's 40 today.",
  the evening is a party, and the scrapbook's year page lists it ("Dana turned 40", "Dana's mom Ruth turned
  60").
- Looks drift with age through Looks that change (`grooming.age_signs`, bank `world/data/ageing.json`): first
  grey hairs, laugh lines and reading glasses at seeded ages, settling in over the years after. Only ages they
  reach in the app count, only looks the app drew change, and the Looks setting shifts how soon.

### Births and growing families

`dungeon/life/families.py` brings babies into the circle, rules only. Each Monday a sibling, cousin, friend or
coworker in the circle aged 24 to 42 may start expecting (a married sibling likeliest), at the pace of Realism >
Their days > Growing families (life setting `growing_families`: 0 none, 1 now and then, 2 true to life, 3 lots;
an easy life starts at 1, a dramatic one at 3). Never the companion's parents, their own partner or someone they
are seeing: their own baby is below.

- A pregnancy is a storyline (`expecting`) with four beats over about seven months: the news with a due month,
  something halfway through, "any day now" and the birth with the baby's name. The old one-line `cousin_baby`
  storyline no longer starts. Ending it on Today means the baby never arrives.
- The baby joins the circle the day they are born (`circle_children`, kept apart from `circle_people`), with that
  birthday, and gets older with it. A sibling's baby is the companion's niece or nephew, a close friend often
  asks them to be the godparent, anyone else's is theirs. `GET /life/circle` adds `children`
  (`[{id, name, pronouns, born_on, age, age_text, relation, title}]`) and `expecting` (the due month) to each
  person.
- Until a child is 13 the companion babysits now and then (their own family and godchildren, when the parent
  lives in town) and hears how they are getting on, as single-beat storylines (`babysat`, `baby_update`) from
  the bank in `world/data/families.json`, at most one a day.
- A first birthday is a big day (dungeon/life/big_days.py `first_birthday`): a party at the parent's place the
  Saturday on or after it, with a gift from the bank and the user asked along by the usual rules. The parent is
  the one there; there is no group chat buzz about it.
- The chat context lists each child under "People in your life" ("- Mia (your niece, a child, 2 years old):
  your sister Ana's daughter.").
- Town couples' babies (dungeon/world/couples.py `babies`) follow the same setting; a companion who knows a
  townsperson well hears they are expecting ("Family news: they're expecting a baby with Dana around March.").
- Children are only ever words: never in pictures, the feed or group chats.

### Companions' own babies

`dungeon/life/own_family.py` (v0.15): a companion who is not the user's romance, living with or married to their
own partner (or married on their sheet), can have a baby with them, rolled on the same Mondays and Growing families
setting, more likely married, by whether they want children (description words first, else seeded) and only while
they are 24 to 44.

- The app picks how: one of them expecting (whoever can carry by pronouns and age) or adopting a newborn (when
  neither can, and now and then in a modern city; an older city takes in a baby to raise). It runs as a storyline,
  `expecting` or `adopting`, with the news, a bank beat (`own_expecting`, `own_adopting`), "any day now" and the
  baby. `GET /life/circle` adds `adopting` (true) next to `expecting` on the partner.
- The child is the companion's own (`circle_children.whose` = `companion`, the partner as `parent_id`): `children`
  items carry `own: true` and `relation` `daughter`, `son` or `child`, and stay listed if the partner leaves the
  circle. Updates come from the parent's side (`own_baby`, `own_toddler`, `own_child`); they never babysit their own.
- Their days change: weeks of parental leave (`Parental leave` in work days off), baby things a month before and
  their half of childcare each month until five (money purchases `baby`, `childcare`).
- A naming day at home six to twelve weeks on (big day `naming`): a best friend is asked to be the godparent in a
  first text (bank `godparent` in big_days.json). No photo, no buzz, called off with the adult side on.
- Now and then (`babysitting` table) they ask the user, in a first text, to babysit for a Saturday evening while
  they and their partner go out; a plain yes or no in the user's first reply answers it, and their evening out
  takes the slot in their day.
- The chat context: "- Ivy (your daughter, a baby, 6 weeks old): yours and your boyfriend Tyler's." and lines for a
  babysitting evening asked, agreed, under way or done.

## Limits and permissions

```http
GET /api/life/settings
PUT /api/life/settings
```

| Field | Default | Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `automatic_events` | `false` | | Commit ordinary events without review (PRD T3). Changing it advances the permission revision, so prepared work is revalidated. |
| `catch_up_on_return` | `true` | | Run a batch on return (PRD T4). |
| `phrase_with_model` | `true` | | Let the connected model reword composed events. Off means template wording and no model calls. |
| `catch_up_max_events` | 3 | 0–6 | Most events in one batch, however long the absence (PRD T5). |
| `catch_up_lookback_hours` | 48 | 6–336 | Only slots this recent are written; older absence stays uneventful. |
| `return_gap_hours` | 4 | 1–48 | Unsimulated time needed before a return batch runs. |
| `background_interval_minutes` | 60 | 15–1440 | Gap between background batches. |
| `background_daily_events` | 3 | 0–8 | Most background events in 24 hours; one per batch. |
| `texts_first` | `true` | | The companion may send the first message (see First messages). Workspaces from before it was on by default are switched on once. |
| `texts_daily` | 2 | 1–6 | Most first messages in 24 hours, for each companion. |
| `away_daily` | 6 | 0–40 | Most first messages in 24 hours from all companions together (`dungeon/away.py`); 0 stops them all. |
| `texts_gap_hours` | 3 | 1–24 | Hours since the last message before the companion writes first. |

Background batches also need `background_activity: true` in `PUT /api/settings`. Pausing
(`POST /api/pause`) stops new batches, and resuming skips the paused interval rather than
generating it.

### Catching up a paused interval

```http
GET  /api/life/pauses
POST /api/life/pauses/{pause_id}/catch-up
```

Resuming never fills in the paused time. If the user deliberately asks for it, call the catch-up
endpoint for that pause. It runs one batch for slots inside the pause, within the same limits as
a return, and returns the same shape as reconcile (`state` is `started`, or `already_done` with the
earlier batch). It is refused (409) while paused or for a pause that has not ended.
`GET /api/life/pauses` lists pauses newest first with `started_at`, `ended_at`,
`catch_up_requested_at` and `catch_up_run_id`.

## First messages

```http
POST /api/life/texts/check   → {state, kind?, message: Message | null, companion_id?, focus?}
```

With `texts_first` on (the default), every companion can start a conversation
(`dungeon/life/openers.py`), the one in focus and the ones you switched away from alike. Each check
sends at most one message: the companion in focus is considered first, then the others, whoever texted
first least recently ahead. Every gate below applies to each companion on their own, and all of them
share one allowance, `away_daily` messages in any 24 hours (`dungeon/away.py`), so a day with the app
left running has a bounded model cost; group chats draw from the same allowance. A sent message carries
`companion_id` and whether that companion is in `focus`. When nobody writes, `state` is the focus
companion's. The open app calls this about once a minute, and the server checks on
its own tick whether or not background activity is on. Fixed triggers decide when, in this order,
each at most once per timeline:

| Kind | When | Needs a model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `follow_up` | A plan the user mentioned ended between an hour and three days ago without an outcome | No (template: "Hey! How did the … go?") |
| `follow_up` | One of the last four messages, from the companion in the last 18 hours, says they want to hear about something later ("I'd like to hear how the search is going later"), and they now have a free moment (below) | No (template: "Okay, free for a minute. How's … going?") |
| `news` | An open thread in the companion's life settled in the last day | Yes |
| `news` | They met another companion around town for the first time in the last day (Small world, above) | No (template: "You'll never guess who I ran into at …") |
| `reminder` | An event committed in the last day shares a distinctive word with a user fact or shared experience | Yes |
| `silence` | Only with an absence trait: no word from the user for two days | No (template by intensity) |
| `usual_time` | The user usually starts a conversation around now (see below) and the companion is free, on a seeded 50% roll per day and stretch, at a seeded minute 0 to 25 minutes into it | No (template by time of the user's day, e.g. "Any lunch plans today?") |
| `check_in` | A free moment, on a seeded roll per day and moment (lunch 50%, after work or class 70%, free evening 35%), at a seeded minute 5 to 50 minutes into it | No (template per moment) |

A free moment is lunch (12:00 to 13:30 in the companion's timezone; a lunch break on a work or study
day, plain midday on a day off, with the same chance), the 90
minutes after a work or study block ends (by the precomputed agenda, so a holiday or sick day is not
work) unless they are in another busy or social block, or a free evening (19:00 to 21:30). Never
while asleep.

The user's usual hours (`dungeon/life/usual_hours.py`) are worked out on the fly, by rules, from
the user's own messages of the last four weeks in the user's timezone, weekdays and weekends apart.
Only messages that start an exchange count: nothing in that conversation for 45 minutes before, and
not an answer to a text the companion started. A half hour is usual when the user started a
conversation in it on at least 3 days and on 30% of the days they wrote; neighbouring half hours join
into one stretch. Nothing is stored and nothing is shown in the app. The companion reaches out in such
a stretch only when their own day leaves them free (a break, or not asleep, working, studying or out
with people), and every gate below still applies.

The model gets the normal chat context plus the reason and its facts, and is told not to add events,
places or people. A reply that is empty, cut off or longer than 600 characters falls back to the
template, or to nothing for triggers without one, and so does one that repeats an earlier companion
message (the same words, or the same first 80 characters ignoring case and punctuation). `state` says why
nothing was sent: `off`,
`paused`, `quiet_hours` (the notification quiet hours, in the user's timezone), `asleep` (a sleep
block in the companion's routine), `recent_conversation`, `waiting_for_answer` (their last first
message is still unanswered; an `occasion` such as the user's birthday still goes out), `daily_cap`, `away_cap`
(the shared allowance is used up), `interrupted` or `nothing`. A sent message is an ordinary
companion message with `reply_to: null`; the chat shows it before the user's next message and the
next reply sees it. With notifications on it is announced (kind `message`) before any waiting
posts, titled with the name of the companion who wrote it; tapping it opens their chat. A forked timeline
keeps the triggers its parent already used.

## Chats and unread messages

```http
GET  /api/chats        → {chats: [{kind, id, thread_id, name, focus, unread, last: {role, text, at} | null, active_at}], unread}
POST /api/chats/read   {thread_id, seq?} → the same list
```

Every chat, the most recently active first (`dungeon/chats.py`): one per companion now (`kind`
`companion`, `id` the companion, `thread_id` their active timeline); group chats add entries of their
own kind. `unread` counts their visible messages after both the last one the user saw (`chat_reads`) and
the user's own last message there; a held reply counts once its time has come. The open chat marks itself
read while the window is visible. The chat header's Chats button opens the list (full screen on a
phone), with the count waiting in the other chats; the Profile tab shows the total. Nothing here says
whether anyone is around: no presence, no read receipts.

## While you were away

```http
GET  /api/conversation/recap        → {recap: {since, days, items: [str]} | null}
POST /api/conversation/recap/read   {since} → {recap: null}
```

When the user's last message to the open companion is at least `life_settings.recap_after_days` old (3 by
default; 0 turns it off, under Settings > Life), the chat opens with a short catch-up (`dungeon/recap.py`):
new life chapters, storylines that moved on, the biggest things they did, how many townsfolk they ran into and
the town paper issues that came out, at most six lines. It is built from what the world already decided, so it
never calls a model, and shows only what the Today view would. Reading it folds it away (`away_recaps`) until the
user is gone for a while again.

## Texting rhythm

How the companion texts is part of their definition: `texting: {bursts, lowercase, typos}`, all off
by default (`dungeon/texting.py`). The character section of the context tells the model the style.
A complete reply is then restyled by fixed rules: all lowercase except links, and with typos on, a
seeded one reply in eight gets one swapped pair of letters and a `*word` line after it. Bursts are
blank-line separated parts, shown as separate bubbles in the Bubbles chat style.

The companion decides when to answer, and the app never says whether they are free: the chat and
Today show no availability (the `availability` field below is for the context only). With the Life
setting `paced_replies` on (the default), a reply to a message sent while they are at work or out is,
by a seeded choice (`dungeon/life/pacing.py`), one of:

- written now and shown later: 8 to 45 minutes at work, 5 to 25 out, never past the end of the block;
- a quick holding text now ("in a meeting, give me a bit", the message's `held_line`) and the full
  reply later;
- a quick short note now instead of a real conversation (the model is told to keep it brief).

Asleep, the reply shows when they wake (at most ten hours). A held reply carries `held_until`; the
chat shows nothing for it (or only the holding text) until then. A reply that shows at once also
shows every earlier one still held, and one held while another is waiting shows no sooner than it,
so replies keep their order. The day that counts is the precomputed agenda's, so a holiday or a sick
day is not work, and a shifted day (see Day disruptions) counts as it ended up. A held reply that
shows while the app is in the background is announced like a first message, unless the user has
written since.

## Day disruptions

Nobody's day goes exactly to plan (`dungeon/life/disruptions.py`). When the agenda writes a slot,
for the companion and for circle members alike, it rolls on a d100 table for that kind of block with
the dice and table logic copied from Prospero's Study (`dungeon/life/chance.py`), seeded by the
slot, so a slot always shifts the same way and a day never changes after the fact:

| Block | No event | Shifts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| work, study | 84% | running late 10 to 45 minutes (9%), staying late 15 to 60 minutes (7%) |
| social | 76% | running late (8%), plans falling through: a quiet night in (11%), something coming up: an errand (5%) |
| leisure | 84% | something coming up (7%), a free circle member dropping by: company (9%) |

Each shift rolls a reason on a child table ("missed the bus", "a meeting ran long"). Running late
moves the slot's start and stretches the slot that ended there (often sleep); staying late moves
its end, and the next slot starts when it ends. A changed block keeps what was `planned` and
carries `shift: {key, minutes, reason, friend, text}`; the composed entry starts with the shift
("Mira ran 20 minutes late (missed the bus). …"). Holidays, sick days and sleep never shift. The
chat context lists today's shifts so far, so the companion knows why they were late, and paced
replies follow the day as it turned out. The Life setting `day_shifts` (on by default) turns it off
for slots written from then on.

## Routine

```http
GET /api/life/routine
```

Returns the companion's routine `blocks`, the `current` and `next` slot (each as in a batch plan;
`current` is `null` between blocks), `timezone`, `default_schedule` (true while the character has
no schedule of its own), `simulated_through`, `now` and `clock_behind`.

Use `current` for availability (PRD C5): a `sleep` or `work` block explains a slow or brief
reply but never locks the conversation.

The schedule is part of the character definition (`POST /api/companion`,
`POST /api/companion/versions`):

```json
"schedule": [
  {"key": "shift", "label": "Bakery shift", "kind": "work", "days": [0,1,2,3,4],
   "start": "06:00", "end": "14:00", "themes": ["regulars", "new recipes"]},
  {"label": "Asleep", "kind": "sleep", "start": "22:30", "end": "06:00"}
],
"life_themes": ["cycling", "the harbour"]
```

`kind` is one of `work`, `study`, `errand`, `leisure`, `social`, `rest`, `sleep`; nothing is
simulated in `sleep` blocks. `days` are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday), all days by default. An `end` at
or before `start` crosses midnight. `key` is optional and derived from the label.

## Today

```http
GET  /api/today
POST /api/today/seen
```

`GET /api/today` returns everything the Today view needs in one call:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `now`, `user_timezone`, `companion_timezone`, `companion_local_time` | Clock context for display |
| `availability` | `{state, label, until}`; `state` is `free`, `working`, `out` or `asleep`, from the current routine block. It explains a slow or short reply and never blocks sending (PRD C5). |
| `routine` | `{default_schedule, current, next}`, as in `GET /api/life/routine` |
| `changes` | Events committed since `last_seen_at`, newest first (the latest ten on a first visit) |
| `review` | Proposed events waiting for the user's commit or reject, oldest first |
| `plans` | `shared`: the user's open plans from memory; `companion`: the companion's upcoming committed plans; `threads`: committed open threads whose outcome is not committed yet |
| `feed_unread` | Unread feed posts |
| `last_run` | The most recent batch, or `null` |
| `paused`, `paused_at`, `simulated_through`, `clock_behind`, `limits` | State for the activity controls |
| `last_seen_at` | When the user last marked Today as seen |
| `day` | The companion's local day: `{date, weather, happenings, birthdays, body}`. `body` is how they feel today (`{state, because}`, see the agenda) or `null`. `weather` is the typical weather (see Weather) or `null`, `happenings` the city's annual events that day, `birthdays` circle members (`{id, name}`) whose birthday it is. Weather and events appear once a reconcile has built the agenda. |
| `mind` | On their mind: `{thoughts: [{day, text}]}`, the last week newest first, or `null` when switched off (see below) |
| `moments` | Little things: the Life deck's moments of the last week, newest first: `{day, title, text, source, picked_by}`, plus `odds` with Hidden values > odds on (see below) |
| `dreams` | Dreams of the last week, newest first: `{day, text, sleep_talk}`, `day` being the morning after (see below) |

Call `POST /api/today/seen` once the user has looked at Today, so the next visit's `changes`
start from here. It never moves backward if the clock does. Event objects in `changes`, `review`
and `plans` have the same shape as `GET /api/events`.

### On their mind

Each evening (from 18:00 the companion's time) Today gets one private thought for that day, worked out by
rules in `dungeon/life/thoughts.py` from what actually happened: a storyline beat or a new life chapter, how a
consequence left them feeling (a mood mark not about the user), money (a surprise bill, a splurge, payday, a tight
week), a plan of theirs in the next three days, a day that went off plan, or, kept light, the user: closeness
reaching a new stage, or that the two of you talked. The weightiest wins, ties go to the day's seeded dice, and a
topic used on either of the two days before steps aside when anything else is there; a quiet day gets a quiet line.
Thoughts are written once, when Today is opened or in the background, and kept in `thoughts`, so the week reads
back as it was; a day never changes after the fact. Nothing a secret they keep could give away is used, and no
emotional trait the character was not given is ever implied.

The wording is a fixed template. With background activity and `phrase_with_model` both on, the life model polishes
one thought a tick at background priority; a polish that drops their name, names a clock time or runs long is
thrown away and the template stays. Thoughts never reach the chat context, so the companion never knows they were
read. The Life setting `on_her_mind` (Settings > Realism > Hidden values, on by default) hides them and stops new ones being written.

### Little things: the Life deck and random tables

```http
POST /api/life/moments/{day}/change   {"way": "another" | "nothing"}
```

Each day of the companion's, `dungeon/life/deck.py` decides with the seeded dice (`life/chance.py`) whether
something small happens and which card it is: a changed habit, an old joke coming back, a late bus. The cards come
from the Life deck (`world/data/life_deck.json`) and from Prospero's Study's d100 random tables reworded for
everyday life (`world/data/random_tables.json`), whose rows join the deck as extra cards weighted by their dice
ranges, so one picker covers both. The drama level sets how often a moment turns up (30, 40, 50 or 60 days in 100)
and which cards can; cards that need someone in the circle or a job wait for one; a card drawn in the last 45 days
steps aside; a card that could give away a secret the companion keeps is never drawn. A day is drawn once, when
Today is opened or in the background, and kept in `life_moments`.

The companion is told today's moment in the chat context ("Something small from your day today"), On their mind can
pick it, and a card with a `share` line can become a first message. With Hidden values > odds on, Today shows each
card's source and odds, and the change endpoint makes it go another way: `another` draws a different card, and
`nothing` makes the day a quiet one. Either returns the week as in `moments`.

### Dreams

Some nights (30 in 100, at most three a week) `dungeon/life/dreams.py` turns the day before into a short dream:
people the companion spent time with, places they went, the day's small moment and, from closeness stage 3 when
you talked that day, the user, mixed by a fixed template with an odd touch from `world/data/dreams.json`. Money
pressure or a plan to look forward to adds a last line. Rarely, someone they live with says they talked in their
sleep. A night is decided once (`dreams`, with the template used). People and places a secret they know is about
never become fragments, and a dream that could still give one away is dropped. There are no nightmares, nothing
romantic or sexual (whoever is in the dream), and a template is not dreamed again within 21 days (`repeat_days`,
30 templates). The morning after, the companion is told about it in the chat context (as a dream, never as something
that happened), and from closeness stage 2 it can become a morning text before noon their time; with model
phrasing off, the template text is used as written.

### Money

```http
GET /api/today/money
```

The companion's budget on their local today, from `dungeon/life/money.py`. It is computed, not
stored: the career's pay tier (`definition.money.career`, else a career named in who they are, else an
ordinary wage), the home city's rents, prices and currency, and `definition.money.style`
(`careful`, `balanced` or `spender`). The same character and date always give the same answer, and
the model only phrases it (chat context section "Your money").

- **Pay**: modern US cities pay a monthly take-home by pay tier, a little higher where rents are
  higher; other cities use their `wage` price, else a multiple of a typical rent. Pay comes every
  other Friday where rent is monthly and every Saturday where it is weekly.
- **Rent**: a neighbourhood named in their location, else one whose rent tier fits their pay. When
  rent would take more than 45% of pay they take a smaller place, or a room in a shared one.
- **Pay period**: fun money runs down through the period. A seeded splurge may land on or after
  payday, and now and then a surprise bill. `tight` marks the low stretch; `cant_afford` lists the
  outings that cost more than what is left.
- **Saving**: `goal` is the user's `saving_for` and `goal` amount (counted from `goal_since`), or a
  seeded everyday goal for each half of the year.

- **Home**: once their home exists (`dungeon/life/home.py`), rent comes from its `monthly_costs`
  (`rent_from: "home"`), pets and vehicles add `upkeep`, and home changes this pay period that cost
  something (`purchases`: a new pet, a repair) are listed in `bought` and come out of what is left.
  Before then the budget's own rent estimate applies (`rent_from: "budget"`). The composer's
  `affordable` check uses the budget without the home, since it has no database.

Where the setting has no money (Oz) or no known city, `available` is `false` with a `reason`.

The composer calls `money.affordable(definition, activity_key, local_date)` once per option: an
outing they cannot afford that day gives way to a free activity (a walk, cooking at home). If
nothing is affordable the routine happens as before.

## Feed

```http
GET  /api/feed?limit=20&before=…&hidden=false&source=all
GET  /api/feed/{post_id}
POST /api/feed/read                {"post_ids": ["…"]}   (omit the body to mark everything read)
POST /api/feed/{post_id}/reaction  {"reaction": "heart"} (heart, laugh, wow, sad, hug, or null to clear)
POST /api/feed/{post_id}/hide
POST /api/feed/{post_id}/unhide
POST /api/feed/{post_id}/remove
POST /api/feed/{post_id}/discuss   {"text": "…", "client_id": "…"}
POST /api/feed/{post_id}/answer    {"option": "Tacos", "client_id": "…"}   (question posts)
POST /api/feed/posts               {"event_id": "…", "intro": "…"}
GET  /api/feed/export
```

`GET /api/feed` returns `{posts, next_before, unread}`, newest first. Pass `next_before` as
`before` to load older posts; it is `null` at the end of the history. `hidden=true` includes
hidden posts. Opening the feed does not mark anything read; call `POST /api/feed/read` for the
posts the user actually saw, so a new post never steals focus or silently disappears from unread.

A post:

```json
{
  "id": "…", "kind": "digest", "intro": "", "status": "visible", "read": false, "read_at": null,
  "reaction": null, "occurs_at": "…", "created_at": "…",
  "events": [{"id": "…", "summary": "Walked to the harbour market.", "caption": "Lovely light today.",
              "mood": "content", "label": "Morning", "kind": "ordinary",
              "starts_at": "…", "ends_at": "…", "revision": 1}],
  "image": {"status": "none", "job_id": null, "ref": null, "error": null, "updated_at": null, "outdated": false}
}
```

- `kind` is `digest` (one per catch-up batch, covering its events) or `event` (one event, from
  background activity or an explicit post).
- A post shows events by reference, always at their current committed revision. Correcting an
  event changes every post that shows it. Proposed events appear only once committed, and
  rejected ones never do, so a post with nothing committed is left out of the feed.
- `caption` is the companion's own line for the moment, falling back to the summary.
- `occurs_at` is the fictional time the post is about; `created_at` is when it was written.
- `image.status` is `none`, `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` or
  `interrupted`; `image.ref` is the job whose file is shown. Render the text whatever the image
  state. `image.outdated` is true when the shown picture was made from an event version that has
  since been corrected or withdrawn; say so rather than presenting it as the corrected moment. See
  [image generation](images.md).
- Hide is reversible. Remove clears the post for good but leaves its events in the companion's
  life and conversation. Removed posts are not listed or exported.
- `discuss` sends a chat message linked to the post and returns the same shape as
  `POST /api/conversation/messages`. The reply is written knowing which post the user meant.
- `POST /api/feed/posts` posts an event committed by other means; it is idempotent per event.
- `export` returns `{format: "prospero-dungeon-feed", version (2), exported_at, companion, posts}`,
  oldest first, hidden posts included.
- Every post has `source` (`life` for the posts above, `social` below), an `author`
  (`{kind: "companion" | "person", id, name, role}`) and an `audience`
  (`{likes: [names], comments: [{author, name, text, at}]}`).

### The social side

`source=companion` keeps only the companion's posts and `source=circle` only their friends'.
Reading the feed or Today writes the social posts due for the last few days
([dungeon/life/social.py](../companion/life/social.py)). No model is involved: everything comes
from the agenda, the circle, the city data and fixed phrasing, under seeded idempotency keys.

- `friend`: a circle member shares a happened diary entry (`text` is their line, `context` what
  happened, `place` where). A few a day across the circle, at most one per person.
- `status`: a passing thought of the companion's from the day's weather, how they feel, the weekday
  or an interest. It never claims anything happened.
- `birthday` (a circle member's birthday), `holiday` (a public holiday), `city` (an opening,
  closing or road works the day people hear of it, or an annual event on its day).
- `question`: an either-or with `options`; `answer` records the user's pick and sends it to chat as
  a reply to the post. `answer` is `null` until then.

Social posts have `events: []` and `image: null`. They are read, reacted to, hidden, removed and
discussed with the same endpoints. Likes and comments are derived, not stored: they come from the
post, the active circle and the clock, arriving within a few hours of the post, at most three
comments each. No line is said twice on one post or repeated on the few posts just before it. The companion likes and comments on friends' posts. A renamed friend shows their new
name; a removed one's posts and comments leave the feed. A branched timeline keeps the social posts from before it split off, with their read, reaction and answer state.

## Going out together and trips

### Plans with the user

When the user asks the companion out ("Want to get dinner Friday?", "Drinks with me Thursday?",
"Coffee Saturday?"), or the companion firmly proposes a plan in a reply, the app saves an outing
([dungeon/life/outings.py](../companion/life/outings.py)). Rules decide everything; the model only
talks about it:

- **What**: dinner, lunch, coffee, drinks, a show, a museum, a walk or a market, from the words used.
- **When**: the asked day and time, else the activity's usual time. A day blocked by work, study,
  sleep, another outing or a trip moves to the next free one within a week, and the companion is
  told the asked day did not work.
- **Where**: the companion picks a real place in their city that fits the activity, the time of day,
  the season, their tastes and their budget (cheap places when money is tight). A place the user
  names is kept.

The plan becomes an agenda block with `with_user: true` (no busy hold, no away line). While it is
under way the chat gets the scene: the place, the spot inside, dishes and prices, and the weather,
and the companion talks face to face. When it ends it leaves a shared memory, a moment picture for
the feed (when an image backend is set up), and the bill comes out of their money (`for: outing`).

### Trips

Every few weeks a companion with money to spare may book a weekend, or a long weekend around a
public holiday, in another real city of the same era within reach
([dungeon/life/trips.py](../companion/life/trips.py)). It is with family who live there, a circle
member, or alone. The trip blocks the waking slots of those days with places in the destination,
ends with the trip home (and maybe a sunburn the next day after a sunny weekend), sends the user a
postcard picture on the first afternoon, and takes its cost from the budget (`for: trip`).

### Endpoints

- `GET /api/life/outings` returns `{outings, trips}` for the active timeline. Each item has a
  `state` of `planned`, `now`, `done` or `cancelled`; outings carry `place`, `named` (the user named
  the place), `asked_date` (when the day moved) and `cost_text`; trips carry `company`, `landmark`,
  `cost_text` and `postcard_message_id`. Outings with the user show on Today under Out together;
  trips show read-only under Trips.
- `POST /api/life/outings/{id}/cancel`, `/elsewhere` (the companion picks another place),
  `/home` (end an outing under way now) and `/undo`. `undo` on an item says it can be taken back:
  calling it off, for the rest of that day while it has not started; heading home, for two
  minutes, and nothing (memory, bill, photo) is kept until then.
- Trips are the companion's own life, so there is nothing to change on them.

## Emotional traits and absence mood

Traits are part of the character definition (`emotional_traits`, empty by default; see PRD C6):
each has a `name`, an `intensity` of `mild`, `moderate` or `strong`, and an optional `note`.

When the user returns at least a day after their last message and a trait's name speaks of
absence, guilt, missing the user, neediness or sulking, the return records a mood (PRD M4).
`GET /api/today` shows it as `mood`, which is `null` otherwise:

```json
"mood": {"id": "…", "kind": "absence", "intensity": "moderate", "away_hours": 72,
         "away_from": "…", "away_until": "…", "traits": ["guilt over absence"],
         "created_at": "…", "expires_at": "…",
         "recorded_traits": [{"name": "guilt over absence", "intensity": "moderate", "note": ""}]}
```

- The intensity never exceeds the current trait's intensity, however long the absence.
- A paused interval is not an absence.
- The mood lasts two days, until the user resets it, or until the traits are removed, whichever
  comes first. Removing the trait ends it from the next reply.
- `POST /api/today/mood/{id}/reset` clears it and returns `{"mood": null}`.

Show the mood plainly in Today with its reset action. Product controls and system notices stay
neutral whatever the traits: never word Settings, Pause or permission prompts in character.
