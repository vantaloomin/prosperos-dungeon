# Story mode

The **Story** tab is the user's own free-form story: they play themself in one of the cities, and a
narrator describes the place and voices the people there. It is apart from every companion. The
story has its own tables (`story_scene`, `story_messages`), and no companion prompt reads them, so
nothing said in the story reaches the companion's chat, memories or life.

## Turning it on

Story mode is opt-in and off by default. It sits beside the companion rather than at the heart of the
app. Turn it on under Settings > Advanced (shown with "Show advanced settings") > Story mode > "Show the
Story tab". That is the `story_mode` workspace setting (`PUT /api/settings {"story_mode": true}`). While it
is off, the Story tab is hidden and every `/api/story` request answers 404 with code `story_off`.
The dating app is its own feature and does not depend on this setting.

## Who decides what

The app decides the scene, the same way the life sim decides the companion's day
(`dungeon/story.py`):

- **Where:** the city and place the user picked under "Go somewhere else…". A new story starts in
  the companion's city (Baltimore without one) at its first cafe. Moving adds a line to the story
  ("You arrive at …") that the narrator sees as a note.
- **When:** the app clock (debug time included) in the city's own timezone.
- **Weather:** the city's typical weather for the date (`generators.conditions`).
- **Who is there:** the townsfolk rules at that moment (`encounters.present`): people seeded at the
  place and residents whose routines bring them there. These are the same people the companion's
  world has. When the story is in the companion's city, it uses the companion's own town seed and
  family names, so a name means the same person in both. Companions are never in the story, including
  ones who stepped back.

The narrator model only voices the scene. Its prompt is "The Story narrator" in Settings > Advanced
(`NARRATOR`, [prompts.md](prompts.md)), followed by a `## Scene` section with the facts above. The
narrator gets the names of the people present, with a rule not to use a name until that person
gives it. The screen lists them only as the user would see them ("the barista", "a
regular").

The narrator stays in the story as companions do. Sentences saying it is an AI are dropped
(`in_character.Guard`), and OOC: or ((…)) gets a plain answer. Its model is the **Story narrator**
job in Settings > Models, which is the conversation profile unless another is chosen.

## API

| Request | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/story` | `{scene, messages, people, ready, can_switch}`. `people` are those met, newest first, with `meetings`, `notes`, `doing` and `place` now. `scene` has the city, place, `local_time` (city clock, no offset), `weather`, the city's `places` and `around` (who is there, named only once met). `ready` is false without a model. |
| `PUT /api/story/scene` `{city_id, place_id?}` | Moves there; a city alone means its opening place. 404 for an unknown city or place. |
| `POST /api/story/messages` `{text, client_id}` | Saves the user's line once per `client_id` and returns `{message, reply}`. A failed reply is saved with `status: failed` and its `error`. Sending the same `client_id` again returns the saved reply, or tries again if it failed. 409 `no_connection` without a model; the line stays saved. |
| `POST /api/story/find` `{key}` | Moves the story to where someone the user has met is now. 404 if not met, 409 if they are nowhere the story can go. |
| `POST /api/story/retry` | Tells the reply to the latest user line again, replacing the one there. |
| `DELETE /api/story` | Starts a new story: the history and the people met go, the scene stays. |

Start over and Delete character keep the story (it is in `start_over.WORKSPACE`).

## People you've met

Someone present in the scene is met once their name comes up, either because the narrator voices them
giving it or because the user uses it (`dungeon/story_people.py`, table `story_people`). Each local day
they come up counts as one meeting. Up to eight sentences of narration that name them are kept as
notes. The next time they are in the scene, the narrator is told the user has met them, how often and
when, along with the latest notes, so they remember the user however far back the story has been
trimmed. The screen then shows their given name ("Dana, the barista").

The list is the user's alone. It is not the companion's `townsfolk_encounters`, and a townsperson keeps no
memories of their own. Under "People you've met" each person shows how often the user has met them and
what their rules have them doing now. "Go to …" moves the story to where they are (refused while they
are at home, at work elsewhere or on their street). "Make … the main character…" opens the usual switch
(`dungeon/cast.py`). `cast.townsperson` accepts anyone met in the story, in any city, and their
profile says "Has met the user in person …".

Other features that put the user with someone (a date, say) record the meeting with
`story_people.meet(connection, sheet, city_id, now, local_day, notes)`.

Starting a new story clears the people met too.

## Planned

- Narrator-played dates with a dating-app match, when Story mode is on. The dating app itself is a
  standalone feature for finding new companions.
